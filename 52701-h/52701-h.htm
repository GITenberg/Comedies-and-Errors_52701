      THE CONFIDANTE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>very one who knew
      Rome fifteen or twenty years ago must remember Miss Belmont. She lived in
      the Palazzo Sebastiani, a merry little old Englishwoman, the business, the
      passion, of whose existence it was to receive. All the rooms of her vast
      apartment on the <i>piano nobile</i> were arranged as reception-rooms,
      even the last of the suite, in the corner of which a low divan, covered by
      a Persian carpet, with a prie-dieu beside it, and a crucifix attached to
      the wall above, was understood to serve at night as Miss Belmont&rsquo;s bed.
      Her day, as indicated by her visiting-card, was Thursday; but to those who
      stood in her good books her day was every day, and&mdash;save for a brief
      hour in the afternoon, when, with the rest of Rome, she drove in the Villa
      Borghese&mdash;all day long. Then almost every evening she gave a little
      dinner. I have mentioned that she was old. She was proud of her age, and
      especially proud of not looking it. &ldquo;I am seventy-three,&rdquo; she used to
      boast, confronting you with the erect figure, the bright eyes, the firm
      cheeks, of a well-preserved woman of sixty. Her rooms were filled with
      beautiful and precious things, paintings, porcelains and bronzes,
      carvings, brocades, picked up in every province of the Continent, &ldquo;the
      spoils of a lifetime spent in rummaging,&rdquo; she said. All English folk who
      arrived in Rome decently accredited were asked to her at-homes, and all
      good Black Italians attended them. As a loyal Black herself, Miss Belmont,
      of course, knew no one in any way affiliated with the Quirinal.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      One of Miss Belmont&rsquo;s Thursday afternoons has always persisted in my
      memory with a quite peculiar vividness. It was fifteen years ago, if you
      will; and yet I remember it, even the details of it, as clearly as I can
      remember the happenings of last week&mdash;as clearly indeed, but oh, how
      much more pleasantly! Was the world really a sweeter, fresher place
      fifteen years ago? Has it really grown stale in fifteen little years? It
      seemed, at any rate, very sweet and fresh, to my undisciplined
      perceptions, on that particular Thursday afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were in December, and there was never so light a touch of frost on the
      air, making it keen and exhilarating. I remember walking down a long
      narrow street, at the end of which the sky hung like a tapestry, splendid
      with the colours of the sunset: a street all clamour and business and
      bustle, as Roman streets are apt to be when there is a touch of the <i>tramontano</i>
      on the air. Cobblers worked noisily, tap-tap-tapping, in their out-of-door
      stalls; hawkers cried their wares, and old women stopped to haggle with
      them; wandering musicians thrummed their guitars and mandolines, singing
      &ldquo;Funiculi, Funiculà,&rdquo; more or less in tune; and cabs rattled perilously
      over the cobble-stones, whilst their drivers shrieked warnings at the
      foot-passengers, citizens soldiers, beggars, priests, like the populace in
      a comic opera.
    </p>
    <p>
      But within the Palazzo Sebastiani the scene was as different as might be.
      Thick curtains were drawn over the windows; innumerable wax candles burned
      and flickered in sconces along the walls; there were flowers everywhere,
      lilies and roses, and the air was heady with their fragrance; there were
      people everywhere too, men in frock-coats, women in furs and velvets,
      monsignori from the Vatican lending a purple note. And there was a
      continuous, confused, rising, falling, murmur of conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had made my obeisance to Miss Belmont, she said, &ldquo;Come. I want to
      introduce you to the Contessa Bracca.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, this will seem improbable, of course; but you know how one sometimes
      has premonitions; and, upon my word, it is the literal fact: I had never
      heard of the Contessa Bracca, her name could convey nothing to me; and
      yet, when Miss Belmont said she wished to present me to her, I felt a
      sudden knock in my heart, I felt that something important was about to
      happen to me. Why?...
    </p>
    <p>
      She was seated in an old high-backed chair of carved ebony, inlaid with
      mother-of-pearl, one of Miss Belmont&rsquo;s curiosities. She wore a jaunty
      little toque of Astrakhan lamb&rsquo;s-wool, with an aigrette springing from it,
      and a smart Astrakhan jacket. It was a singularly pleasant face, a
      singularly pretty and witty and interesting face, that looked up in the
      soft candle-light, and smiled, as Miss Belmont accomplished the
      presentation; it was a singularly pleasant voice, gentle, yet crisp,
      characteristic, that greeted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Belmont had spoken to the Contessa in English; and the Contessa
      spoke to me in English, with no trace of an accent. I was surprised; and I
      was shy and awkward. So I could think of nothing better than to exclaim&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are English!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled&mdash;it was a quiet little amused but kindly smile, rather a
      lightening of her eyes than a movement of her features&mdash;and said,
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you would be Italian,&rdquo; I confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was still smiling. &ldquo;And are you inconsolable to find that I&rsquo;m not?&rdquo;
       she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. On the contrary, I am very glad,&rdquo; I assured her, with sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, her smile rippled into laughter; and she murmured something in
      which I caught the words &ldquo;youth&rdquo; and &ldquo;engaging candour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not so furiously young,&rdquo; I protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyebrows, gazing at me quizzically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m twenty-two,&rdquo; I announced, with satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; She laughed again. &ldquo;And twenty-two you regard as the beginning
      of old age?&rdquo; she suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events, one is no longer a child at twenty-two,&rdquo; I argued
      solemnly, &ldquo;especially if one has seen the world a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My conversation appeared to divert her more than I could have hoped; for
      still again she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, &ldquo;Ah, wait till you&rsquo;re my age&mdash;wait till you&rsquo;re a hundred and
      fifteen,&rdquo; she pronounced in a hollow voice, making her face long, and
      shaking her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was my turn to laugh now. Afterwards, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re much
      older than I am,&rdquo; I confided to her, with bluff geniality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference between twenty-two and thirty&mdash;especially when
      one has seen the world a bit?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re never thirty,&rdquo; I expostulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An experienced old fellow of two-and-twenty,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;must surely
      be aware that people do sometimes live to attain the age of thirty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not thirty,&rdquo; I reiterated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but unless I&rsquo;m careful, I shall be, before I
      know it. Have you been long in Rome?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m an old Roman,&rdquo; I replied airily. &ldquo;We used to come here when I was
      a child. And I was here again when I was eighteen, and again when I was
      twenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Then you will be able to put me up to the tricks of
      the town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, but you live here, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; I wondered simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose I live here,&rdquo; she assented. &ldquo;I live in the Palazzo
      Stricci, you must come and see me. I&rsquo;m at home on Mondays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you; I&rsquo;ll come the very first Monday that ever is,&rdquo; I vowed.
      For, though she had teased me and laughed at me, I thought she was very
      charming, all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and how did you get on with the Countess Bracca?&rdquo; Miss Belmont
      asked. When I had answered her, she proceeded, as her wont was, to
      volunteer certain information. &ldquo;She was a Miss Wilthorpe, you know&mdash;the
      Cumberland Wilthorpes, a staunch old Catholic family. Her mother was a
      Frenchwoman, a Montargier. Monsignor Wilthorpe is her cousin. Her husband,
      Count Bracca, held a commission in the Guardia Nobile&mdash;between
      ourselves, a creature of starch and whalebone, a pompous noodle. She was
      married to him when she was eighteen. He died three or four years ago: a
      good thing too. But she has continued to live in Rome, in the winter. In
      the summer she goes to England, to her people. Did she ask you to go and
      see her? Go, on the first occasion. Cultivate her. She&rsquo;s clever. She&rsquo;ll do
      you good. She&rsquo;ll form you,&rdquo; Miss Belmont concluded, looking at me with a
      critical eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      On Monday, at the Palazzo Stricci, I was ushered through an immense sombre
      drawing-room, and beyond, into a gay little blue-and-white boudoir. The
      Contessa was there alone. &ldquo;I am glad you have come early,&rdquo; she was good
      enough to say. &ldquo;We can have a talk together, before any one else arrives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wore a delightful white frock, of some flexile woollen fabric
      embroidered in white silk with leaves and flowers. And I discovered that
      she had very lovely hair, great quantities of it, undulating richly away
      from her forehead; hair of an indescribable light warm brown, a sort of
      fawn colour, with reflections dimly red. She was seated in the corner of a
      sofa, leaning upon a cushion of blue satin covered with white lace. I had
      not noticed her hair the other day at Miss Belmont&rsquo;s, in the vague
      candle-light. Now I could not take my eyes from it. It filled me with
      astonishment and admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I said&mdash;I suppose I blushed and stammered, but I had to say it&mdash;&ldquo;you&mdash;you
      must let me tell you&mdash;what&mdash;what wonderful hair you have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor lady! She shook her head; she lay back in her place and laughed.
      &ldquo;Forgive me, forgive me for laughing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But&mdash;your
      compliment&mdash;it was a trifle point-blank&mdash;I was slightly
      unprepared for it. However, you&rsquo;re quite right. It&rsquo;s not bad hair,&rdquo; she
      conceded amiably. &ldquo;And it was very&mdash;very natural and&mdash;and nice&mdash;of
      you to mention it. Now sit down here, and we will have a good long talk,&rdquo;
       she added. &ldquo;You must tell me all about yourself. We must get acquainted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was always, perhaps, the tiniest point of raillery in that crisp
      voice, in those gleaming eyes, of hers; but it did not prevent them from
      being friendly and interested. She went on to ask me all manner of
      friendly, interested questions, adopting, apparently as a matter of
      course, the tone of maturity addressing ingenuous youth; and I found
      myself somehow accepting that relation without resentment. Where had I
      made my studies? What was I going to do in the world? She asked me
      everything; and I, guilelessly, fatuously no doubt, responded. I imagine I
      expatiated at some length, and with some fervour, upon my literary
      aspirations, whilst she encouraged me with her kind-glowing eyes; and I am
      afraid&mdash;I am afraid I even went so far as to allow her to persuade me
      to repeat divers of my poems. In those days one wrote things one fondly
      nicknamed poems. Anyhow, I know that I was enjoying myself very much
      indeed&mdash;when we were interrupted by the entrance of another caller.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then a whole stream of callers passed through her dainty room: men and
      women, old and young; all of them people with a great deal of manner, and
      not much else&mdash;certainly with precious little wit. The men were
      faultlessly dressed, they had their hair very sleekly brushed, they
      caressed their hats, grinned vacuously, and clacked out set phrases; the
      women gossiped turbulently in Italian; and my hostess gave them tea, and
      smiled (was there just a tinge of irony in her smile?), and listened with
      marvellous endurance. But I thought to myself, &ldquo;Oh, if this is the kind of
      human society you are condemned to, how ineffably you must be bored!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I met her a few days later in the Villa Borghese. I was one of many
      hundred people walking there, in the afternoon; her victoria was one of
      the long procession of carriages. She made her coachman draw up, and
      signed to me to come and speak with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I should get down and walk with you a bit, do you think you would be
      heart-broken?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I offered her my hand, and helped her to alight. She had on the toque and
      jacket of Astrakhan in which I had first seen her, and she carried an
      Astrakhan muff. The fresh air had brought a beautiful soft colour to her
      cheeks; her hair glowed beautifully in the sunlight. As she walked beside
      me, I perceived that she was nearly as tall as I was, and I noticed the
      strong, fine, elastic contours of her figure. We turned away from the
      road, and walked on the grass, among the solemn old trees; and we
      talked... I can&rsquo;t in the least remember of what&mdash;of nothings, very
      likely&mdash;only, I do remember that we talked and talked, and that I
      found our talk exceedingly agreeable. I remember, too, that at a given
      moment we passed a company of students from the German College, their
      scarlet cassocks flashing in the sun; and I remember how each of those
      poor priestlings stole an admiring glance at her from the corner of his
      eyes. But upon my calling her attention to the circumstance, though she
      couldn&rsquo;t help smiling, she tried to frown, and reproved me. &ldquo;Hush. You
      shouldn&rsquo;t observe such things. You must never allow yourself to think
      lightly of the clergy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I had conducted her back to her carriage, she said, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I set you
      down somewhere?&rdquo; So I got in and drove with her, through the animated
      Roman streets, to the door of my lodgings. On the way, &ldquo;You must come and
      dine with me some evening,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When will you come? Will you come
      on Wednesday? Quite quietly, you know.&rdquo; And I assured her that I should be
      delighted to come on Wednesday.
    </p>
    <p>
      But afterwards, when I was alone, I repeatedly caught myself thinking of
      her&mdash;thinking of her with enthusiasm. &ldquo;She <i>is</i> a nice woman,&rdquo; I
      thought. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s an awfully nice woman. Except my own mother, I believe
      she&rsquo;s the nicest woman I have ever known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may interest you to learn that I took occasion to tell her as much on
      Wednesday.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other guests at her dinner had been Miss Belmont and the Contessa&rsquo;s
      cousin, Monsignor Wilthorpe, a tall, iron-grey, frigid man, of
      forty-something; and they left together very early, Miss Belmont
      remarking, &ldquo;People who are not in their first youth can&rsquo;t afford to lose
      their beauty-sleep. Come, Monsignore, you must drive me home.&rdquo; I feared it
      was my duty to leave directly after them, but upon my rising to do so the
      Contessa cried out, &ldquo;What! Do you begrudge losing your beauty-sleep too?
      It&rsquo;s not yet ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; I was only too glad to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went from the great melancholy drawing-room, where we had taken our
      coffee, into her boudoir. I can&rsquo;t tell you how cosy and charming and
      intimate it seemed, in the lamplight, with its bright colours, and with
      all her little personal possessions scattered about, her books, bibelots,
      writing-materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you allowed to smoke?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Am I?&rdquo; was my retort.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed. &ldquo;Yes. I think you deserve to, after that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I lighted a cigarette, with gratitude; while she sat down at her piano and
      began to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you care for Bach? No, you are too young to care for Bach. But you
      will come to him. At your age one loves Chopin. Chopin interprets the
      strenuous moments of life, the moments that seem all important when they
      are present, but matter so little in the long run. Bach interprets life as
      a whole, seen from a distance, seen in perspective, in its masses and
      proportions, in its serene symmetry, when nothing is strenuous, when
      everything seems right and in its place, when even sorrow seems right. At
      my age one prefers Bach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said all this as she was playing, speaking slowly, dreamily, between
      the chords. &ldquo;If that is Bach which you are playing now, I like it very
      much,&rdquo; I made bold to affirm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the third fugue,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s precocious of you to like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I give you my word, I&rsquo;m not half so juvenile as you&rsquo;re always trying
      to make me out,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me with her indulgent, quizzical smile. &ldquo;No, to be sure.
      You&rsquo;re a cynical old man of the world&mdash;of twenty-two,&rdquo; she teased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she abandoned the piano, and took her place of the other day, in
      the corner of her sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what do you do here in Rome? What are your
      occupations? How do you spend your time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my occupations are entirely commonplace,&rdquo; I answered her. &ldquo;In the
      morning&rsquo; I try to write. Then in the afternoon I pay calls, or go to some
      one&rsquo;s studio, or to the museums, or what not. And in the evening I
      generally dine with some men I know at the Caffé di Roma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, with one thing and another, you&rsquo;re quite happy?&rdquo; she suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this recalled me, of a sudden, to the rôle I was at that season
      playing to myself in the human comedy. Ingenuous young men (a. friend of
      mine often says), if they happen to have an active imagination, are the
      most inveterate, the most incorrigible of poseurs. To make the matter
      worse, they&rsquo;re the first&mdash;if not the only&mdash;ones to be taken in
      by their pose. They believe in it heartily; they&rsquo;re supremely unconscious
      that they&rsquo;re posing. And so they go on, slipping from one pose to another,
      till in the end, by accident as like as not, they find the pose that suits
      them. And when a man has found the pose that suits him (I am still quoting
      my friend) we say that he has &ldquo;found himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Contessa&rsquo;s suggestion recalled me to my pose of the season. I
      repudiated the idea of happiness with scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy!&rdquo; I echoed bitterly. &ldquo;I should think not. I shall never be happy
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy upon me!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Si jeune, et déjà Moldave-Valaque!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I informed her, with Byronic gloom, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t a laughing matter. I&rsquo;m
      the most miserable of men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy,&rdquo; she said compassionately; and her eyes shone with compassion
      too, though perhaps there still lingered in them just the faintest
      afterglow of amusement. &ldquo;Why are you miserable? What is it all about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the usual story. When a man&rsquo;s hopelessly unhappy, when
      his last illusion has been destroyed, it&rsquo;s always&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry to say
      it to you, but you know whether it&rsquo;s true&mdash;it&rsquo;s always a member of
      your sex that&rsquo;s to blame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Had she a struggle to keep from laughing? If so, she came out of it
      victorious. Indeed, the compassion in her eyes seemed to deepen. &ldquo;Poor
      boy,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;What have they done to you? Tell me all about it. It
      will do you good to tell me. Let me be your confidante,&rdquo; she urged gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thereupon (oh, fatuity!) I strode up and down her floor, and narrated
      the whole history of my desperate, my fatal passion for Elsie Milray: how
      beautiful Elsie was, how mysteriously, incommunicably fascinating; how I
      had adored her; how she had encouraged me, led me on, trifled with me, and
      finally thrown me over&mdash;for Captain Bullen, a fellow in the
      Engineers, old enough to be&mdash;well, almost old enough to be her
      father. I fancy I swung my arms about a good deal, and quoted Heine and
      Rossetti, and generally made myself very tiresome and ridiculous; but my
      kind confidante listened with patience, with every appearance of taking my
      narration seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; I concluded, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been hard hit, hit in a vital spot. My
      wound is one of those that never heal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even that did not provoke her to laughter. She gazed at me meditatively
      for a moment, and then she shook her head. &ldquo;Your wound will heal. When our
      wounds are fresh, it always seems as if they would never heal. But they do
      heal. Yours will heal. You must try to think of other things. You must try
      to interest yourself in other girls&mdash;oh, platonically, I mean, of
      course. There are lots of nice girls in the world, you know. You must try
      not to think of Elsie. It&rsquo;s no good thinking of her, now that she&rsquo;s
      engaged to Captain Bullen. But&mdash;but when you can&rsquo;t help thinking of
      her, then you must come to me and talk it out. That is always better,
      healthier, than brooding upon a grief in silence. You must come to me
      whenever you feel you wish to. I shall always be glad when you come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a&mdash;you&rsquo;re an angel of kindness,&rdquo; I declared, with emotion. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
      was thinking only the other day, when you had driven me home from the
      Borghese, I was thinking that, except my own mother, you&rsquo;re the&mdash;the
      best and dearest woman in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at this, she could be grave no longer. She laughed gaily. &ldquo;If I come
      next to your mother in your affections,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s almost as if I
      were your grandmother, isn&rsquo;t it? Yes, that is it. I&rsquo;ll be a grandmother to
      you.&rdquo; And she made me a comical little <i>moue</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, it was my excellent fortune to see the Contessa Bracca rather
      frequently. I called on her a good deal; she asked me to dine and lunch
      with her a good deal; I spent a surprising number of afternoons and
      evenings in her blue-and-white retiring-room. Then she used to take me to
      drive with her in the Villa Borghese or on the Pincian; and sometimes we
      would go for walks together in the Campagna. Of course, I was a regular
      visitor in her box at the opera: otherwise, the land had not been Italy,
      nor the town Rome. I liked her and enjoyed her inexpressibly; she was so
      witty and lively, so sympathetic, such a frank good comrade; she was so
      pretty and delicate and distinguished. &ldquo;I can never make you understand,&rdquo;
       I confessed to her, &ldquo;how much fuller and richer and more delightful life
      is since I have known you.&rdquo; I was, in fact, quite improbably happy, though
      I scarcely suspected it at the time. I had not forgotten that my rôle was
      the disconsolate lover; I must still now and again perorate about Elsie,
      and grieve over my painted wounds. The Contessa always listened patiently,
      with an air of commiseration. And I read her every line I wrote (poor
      woman!) whilst she criticised, suggested, encouraged. The calf is a queer
      animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may wonder how she managed to put up with me, why I did not bore her
      to extermination. I can&rsquo;t answer&mdash;unless, indeed, it was simply that
      she had a sense of humour, as well as a kind heart. I am glad to be able
      to remember, besides, that our talks were by no means confined to subjects
      that had their source in my callow egotism. We talked of many things, we
      talked of everything: of books, pictures, music; of life, nature,
      religion; of Rome, its churches and palaces, its galleries and gardens; of
      people, of the people we knew in common, of their traits, their qualities,
      defects, absurdities. We talked of everything; sometimes&mdash;but all too
      infrequently&mdash;we talked of her. All too infrequently. I can&rsquo;t think
      how she contrived it; she was as far as possible from giving the
      impression of being reserved with me; yet, somehow, it was very seldom
      indeed that we talked of her. Somehow, for the most part&mdash;with no
      sign of effort, easily, imperceptibly even&mdash;she avoided or evaded the
      subject, or turned it if it was introduced. Only, once in a long while,
      once in a long, long while, she would, just for an instant, as it were,
      lift a corner of the curtain; tell me some little anecdote, some little
      incident, out of her life; allow me never so fleeting a glimpse into the
      more intimate regions of her experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, for example, one afternoon in February, when a faint breath of
      spring was on the air, we had driven out to Acqua Acetosa, and there we
      had left her carriage and strolled in the open country, plucking armfuls
      of flowers, anemones, jonquils, competing with each other to see who could
      gather the greatest number in the fewest minutes, and laughing and romping
      mirthfully. Her hair had got into some disarray, her cheeks glowed, her
      eyes sparkled; and her face looked so young, so young, that I exclaimed,
      &ldquo;Do you know, you are exactly like a girl to-day. I told you once that you
      were the nicest woman I had ever known; but to-day I shall have to take
      that back, and tell you you&rsquo;re the nicest girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, sweetly, joyously. &ldquo;I <i>am</i> a girl to-day,&rdquo; she said. But
      then, all at once, her eyes became sober, thoughtful; there was even a
      shadow of trouble in them. &ldquo;You see, I never was really a girl,&rdquo; she went
      on. &ldquo;I am living my girlhood now&mdash;as a kind of accidental
      after-thought&mdash;because I have happened to make friends with a boy. I
      am sowing my wild oats&mdash;gathering my wild flowers&mdash;at the
      eleventh hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean&mdash;you were never really a girl?&rdquo; I questioned
      stupidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will guess what I felt&mdash;her eyes suddenly filled with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was stammering out some apology, but she stopped me. &ldquo;No, no. It isn&rsquo;t
      your fault. I&rsquo;m not crying. It&rsquo;s all right. I meant I was never a girl,
      because I was married at eighteen. That is all. And I&rsquo;ve had to be dull
      and middle-aged ever since,&rdquo; she added, smiling again. &ldquo;You dull and
      middle-aged!&rdquo; I scoffed at the notion. But her tears, and then her word
      about her marriage, had touched me poignantly. She had never mentioned,
      she had never remotely alluded to her marriage, before, in all our
      intercourse. Certainly, I knew, from things Miss Belmont had said, that it
      had not been a happy marriage. The Con-tessa&rsquo;s word about it now, brief as
      it was, slight as it was, moved me like a cry of pain. I felt a great
      anguish, a great anger, to think that circumstances had been cruel to her
      in the past; a great yearning in some way to be of comfort to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I cried out&mdash;tactlessly, if you will; but my emotion was
      dominant; I could not stop to reflect&mdash;&ldquo;oh, why&mdash;why didn&rsquo;t I
      know you in those days? Why wasn&rsquo;t I here&mdash;to&mdash;to help you&mdash;to
      defend you&mdash;to&mdash;to make it easier for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were in the carriage by this time, rolling swiftly back towards Rome.
      She did not speak. I did not look at her. But I felt her hand laid gently
      upon mine, her little light gloved hand; and then her hand pressed mine, a
      long soft pressure that said vastly more than speech; and then her hand
      rested there, lightly, lightly, and we were both silent, till we reached
      the Porta del Popolo.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had left her, I was conscious of a curious elation, a curious
      exaltation. It was almost as if my confidante had made me her confidant. A
      new honour had been conferred upon me, a new trust and responsibility.
      &ldquo;Oh, I will devote my life to her,&rdquo; I vowed fervently, in my soul. &ldquo;I will
      devote my life to making her happy, to compensating her in some measure
      for what she has suffered in the past. When shall I see her again?&rdquo; I was
      consumed with eagerness, with impatience, to see her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw her, as a matter of fact, no later than the next day. I called on
      her in the afternoon. I went to her, meditating heroics. I would lay my
      life at her feet, I would ask her to let me be her knight, her servant. I
      looked forward to rather a fine moment. But it takes two to make a
      melodrama. She met me in a mood that sealed the heroics in my bosom; a
      teasing, elusive mood, her eyes, her voice, all mockery, all mischief.
      &ldquo;Tiens, c&rsquo;est mon petit-fils,&rdquo; she cried, on my arrival. &ldquo;Bonjour, Toto.
      How nice of you to come and see your granny.&rdquo; There were days when she was
      like this, when she would never drop her joke about being my grandmother,
      and perpetually called me &ldquo;Toto,&rdquo; and talked to me as if I were
      approaching seven. &ldquo;Now, sit down on the floor before the fire,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;and gwandmamma will tell you a stor-wy.&rdquo; A sprite danced in her eyes. Her
      drawling enunciation of the last word was irresistible. I laughed, despite
      myself; and thoughts of high rhetoric had summarily to be dismissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      When I look back upon my life as it was in those days, I protest I am
      filled with a sort of envy. A boy of twenty-something, his pockets
      comfortably supplied with money; free from morning to night, from night to
      morning, to do as his fancy prompted; with numberless pleasant
      acquaintances; and in the most beautiful country, the most interesting
      city, of two hemispheres&mdash;in Italy, in Rome: yes, indeed, as I look
      back at him, I am filled with envy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then, when I think of <i>her</i>.... I think of her, and she becomes
      visible before me, visible in all her exquisite grace and fineness, her
      exquisite femininity. I see her intimate little room, its gay blue and
      white, its pretty furniture, its hundred pretty personal trifles, tokens
      of her habitation; I breathe the air of it, the faint, soft perfume that
      was always on its air; I see her fan, her open book, her handkerchief
      forgotten on a table. I see her, in the room. I see her delicate white
      face, witty, alert, sensitive; I see her laughing eyes, her hair, the
      sumptuous masses of her hair. I see her hands, I touch them, slender,
      fragile, but warm, but firm and responsive. I see the delicious toilet she
      is wearing, I hear the brisk frou-frou of it. I hear her voice. I see her
      at her piano, I see her as she plays, the bend of her head, the motion of
      her body. I see her as she glances up at me, whimsically smiling, asking
      me something, telling me something. I gaze long at her, hungrily. And
      then, remembering that there was a time when I could see her like this in
      very reality as often as I would&mdash;oh, I can only cry out to myself of
      those days, &ldquo;You lucky heathen, you lucky, lucky heathen! How little you
      realised, how little you merited, your extraordinary fortune!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course, I was in love with her. But as yet, upon my conscience, I did
      not know it. I knew that I was tremendously fond of her, that I was never
      so happy as when in her presence, that I was always more or less
      unsatisfied and restless when out of it. I knew that I was always more or
      less unsatisfied and restless, too, when other men were hovering about
      her, when she was laughing and talking with other men. I knew that I
      wished to be her knight, her servant, to dedicate my existence to her
      welfare. But beyond that, I had not analysed my sentiment, nor given it a
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, if you please, I was still able to go on prating to her of Elsie
      Milray!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there came a day when I ceased to prate of Elsie... It was during
      the Carnival. Miss Belmont had taken a room in the Corso, from the balcony
      of which, that afternoon, she and various of her friends had watched the
      merrymaking. The Contessa Bracca was expected, but the hours wore away,
      and she did not turn up. I waited for her, hoped for her, from minute to
      minute, to the last. Then I went home in a fine state of depression.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner&mdash;and after much irresolution, ending in an abrupt
      resolve&mdash;I ventured to present myself at the Palazzo Stricci.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was alarmed about you. I was afraid you might be ill,&rdquo; I explained. I
      felt a great rush of relief, of warmth and peace, at seeing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was seated in a low easy-chair, by her writing-table, with a volume of
      the &ldquo;Récit d&rsquo;une Sour&rdquo; open in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not ill,&rdquo; she said, rising, and putting her book aside. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
      sorry you thought so, though, since it has procured me the pleasure of a
      visit from you,&rdquo; she added, smiling, as she gave me her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her face was pale, her smile seemed like a pale light that just
      flickered on it for an instant, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at her with anxiety. &ldquo;You <i>are</i> ill,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      something the matter. What is it? Tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. Really. I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; she insisted, with a little movement of
      the head, that was meant to be reassuring. &ldquo;Sit down, and light a
      cigarette, and give me a true and faithful account of the day&rsquo;s doings.
      Who was there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. You weren&rsquo;t. That was the important thing. We missed you
      awfully. Your absence entirely spoiled the afternoon,&rdquo; I declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyebrows. &ldquo;I can imagine how they must all have pined for
      me. Did they commission you to speak for them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I pined for you, at any rate,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I kept looking for you,
      expecting you. Every minute, up to the very end, I still hoped for you. If
      you&rsquo;re not ill, or anything, why didn&rsquo;t you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vanity. I was having a plain day, I didn&rsquo;t like to show myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at her with anxiety, narrowly. &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; I blurted out, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
      the use of beating about the bush? I know there&rsquo;s something wrong. I
      should have to be blind not to see it. If you&rsquo;re not ill, then you&rsquo;re
      unhappy about something. I can&rsquo;t help it&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t like my
      speaking of it, send me away. But I can&rsquo;t sit here and talk small-talk,
      when I know that you&rsquo;re unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you know that I&rsquo;m unhappy, you might sit here and talk small-talk, to
      cheer me up,&rdquo; she suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you&rsquo;ve been crying,&rdquo; I exclaimed, all at once understanding an
      odd brightness in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and even so? Hasn&rsquo;t one a right to cry, if it amuses one?&rdquo; she
      questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been crying about?&rdquo; questioned I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been crying over my faded beauty&mdash;because I&rsquo;ve had a plain
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t try to turn the matter to a jest,&rdquo; I pleaded. &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t bear to think of you crying. I can&rsquo;t bear to think of you unhappy.
      What is it? I wish you&rsquo;d tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really wish it?&rdquo; she asked, with a sudden approach to gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes,&rdquo; I answered eagerly. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re unhappy, I want to know
      it, I want to share it with you. You&rsquo;re so good, you&rsquo;re so dear, I wish I
      could take every pain in the world away from you, I wish I could protect
      you from every breath of pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes softened beautifully, they shone into mine with a beautiful
      gentleness. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dear boy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a great comfort to your
      grandmother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; I urged, &ldquo;the least you can do is to tell me what has
      happened to make my grandmother unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing has happened. I&rsquo;ve been thinking. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinking what? What have you been thinking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinking&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo; she began, as if she
      was about to answer; but then she made a teasing little face at me, and
      declaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Oh, thinking, if you like,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      How utterly dissociated was I,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A priest and celibate, from the sad strange wife
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Of Guido.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I threw up my hands in despair. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re hopeless,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good
      ever expecting you to be serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious enough, in all conscience,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but I conceal it. I
      let concealment, like a worm in the bud, feed on my damask cheek. And so&mdash;I
      have plain days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ve ever had a plain day in your life,&rdquo; asserted I.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the most beautiful woman in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would beg you to observe that you&rsquo;re sitting here and talking
      small-talk, after all,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t small-talk. It&rsquo;s the
      solemn truth. But look here. I&rsquo;m not going to let you evade the question.
      What have you been unhappy about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not unhappy any more. So what does it matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know. Tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been puzzling over a dilemma,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;an excessively perplexed
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes? Go on,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wondering whether I&rsquo;d better marry Ciccolesi, or retire into a
      convent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ciccolesi!&rdquo; I cried, in astonishment, in dismay. &ldquo;Marry Ciccolesi! You!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Cavalière Ciccolesi. You&rsquo;ve met him here on Mondays, A brown man,
      with curly hair. He&rsquo;s done me the honour of offering me his hand. Would
      you advise me to accept it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accept it?&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Good Lord! You must be&mdash;have you lost your
      reason? Ciccolesi&mdash;that automaton&mdash;that cardboard stalking-horse&mdash;that
      Neapolitan jackanapes! You&mdash;think of marrying him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could only walk up and down the room and wave my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;then I see there&rsquo;s nothing for it but the other
      alternative&mdash;to retire into a convent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I halted and stared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;what on earth has happened to make you talk like this?&rdquo; I
      demanded, in a sort of gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been reflecting upon the futility of my life,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I get up
      in the morning, and eat my breakfast. Then I fritter away an hour or two,
      and eat my luncheon. Then I fritter away the afternoon, and eat my dinner.
      Then I fritter away the evening, and go to bed. I live, apparently, to eat
      and sleep, like the beasts that perish. We must reform all that. I must do
      something to make myself of use in the world. And since you seem
      disinclined to sanction a marriage with Ciccolesi, what do you say to my
      joining some charitable sisterhood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke lightly, even, if you will, half-jocosely. But there was a real
      bitterness unmistakable behind her tone. There was a bitterness in her
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I&mdash;I was overwhelmed, penetrated, by a distress, by an emotion,
      such as I had never known before. I looked at her through a sort of mist&mdash;of
      pain, of passion; with a kind of aching helplessness; longing to say
      something, to do something, I could not tell what. Her smile had faded
      out; her face was white, set; her eyes were sombre. I looked at her, I
      longed to say something, to do something, and I could not move or speak.
      My mind was all a whirl, a bewilderment&mdash;till, somehow, gradually,
      from some place in the background of it, her name, her Christian name,
      struggled forward into consciousness. I seemed to see it before me, like a
      written word, her name, Gabrielle. And then I heard myself calling it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabrielle! Gabrielle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I heard my voice, I found myself kneeling beside her, holding her hands,
      speaking close to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabrielle! I can&rsquo;t let you&mdash;I can&rsquo;t allow you to think such things.
      <i>Your</i> life futile! Your beautiful, beautiful life! Gabrielle&mdash;my
      love! Oh, my love, my love!&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by, laughing, sobbing, her eyes melting with a heavenly tenderness,
      she said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s absurd, it&rsquo;s impossible. You&rsquo;re only a boy. I&rsquo;m a woman.
      I&rsquo;m seven years older than you&mdash;in years. I&rsquo;m immeasurably older in
      everything else. But I can&rsquo;t help it&mdash;I love you. You&rsquo;re only a boy&mdash;and
      yet&mdash;you&rsquo;re such an honest, frank, sweet boy&mdash;and my life has
      been passed with such artificial people, such unreal people&mdash;you&rsquo;re
      the only <i>man</i> I have ever known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning one of her servants brought me a letter. Here it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Friend,&mdash;Please do not come to see me this afternoon. I
      shall not be at home. I am leaving town. I am going to the Convent of
      Saint Veronica; I shall pass Lent there, with the good sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest, do not be angry with me. I cannot accept your love, I have no
      right to accept it. Our friendship, our companionship, has been infinitely
      precious to me; it has given me a belief in human nature which I never had
      before. But you are young, you are still <i>growing</i>&mdash;in mind, in
      spirit. You must be free. I cannot cramp your youth, your growth, by
      accepting your love. Look, my dear, it would be an <i>impasse</i>. We
      could not marry. It would be monstrous if I should let you marry me&mdash;at
      the end of a year, at the end of six months, you would hate me, you would
      feel that I had spoiled your life. Yes, it is true. You must be free&mdash;you
      must grow. You must not handicap yourself at twenty-two by marrying a
      woman seven years your senior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what then? Nothing but this&mdash;I must not accept your love,
      dear, I must give you up. You will go on, on; you will grow, you will
      outgrow the love you bear me now. You will live your life. And some day
      you will meet a woman of your own age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the pain this letter will give you; I know, I know. You will be
      unhappy, you will be angry with me. Dearest, try to forgive me. I am doing
      the only thing there is for me to do. You will be glad of it in the
      future. You will shudder to think, &rsquo;What if that woman had taken me at my
      word!&rsquo;&mdash;Oh, why weren&rsquo;t you born ten years earlier, or I ten years
      later?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to the Convent of Saint Veronica, to pass Lent. Perhaps I
      shall stay longer. Perhaps&mdash;do not cry out, it is not a sudden
      resolution&mdash;perhaps I shall remain there, as an oblate. I could teach
      music, French. I must do something. I must not lead this idle futile life.
      Do not think of me as undergoing hardships. The rule for an oblate is not
      severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, dear. I pray God to bless you in every way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabrielle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Don&rsquo;t ask me what I felt, what I did....
    </p>
    <p>
      Lent dragged itself away, but she did not return to Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then one day I received by post a copy of the <i>Osservatore Romano</i>,
      with a marked paragraph. It announced that the Contessa Bracca had been
      received into the Pious Community of Saint Veronica as a noble oblate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her letter, and that paragraph, cut from the <i>Osservatore Romano</i>,
      lie before me now, on my writing-table. Don&rsquo;t ask me what I feel, as I
      look at them.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>y dear,&rdquo; said the
      elder man, &ldquo;as I&rsquo;ve told you a thousand times, what you need is a
      love-affair with a red-haired woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bother women,&rdquo; said the younger man, &ldquo;and hang love-affairs. Women are a
      pack of samenesses, and love-affairs are damnable iterations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were seated at a round table, gay with glass and silver, fruit and
      wine, in a pretty, rather high-ceiled little grey-and-gold breakfast-room.
      The French window stood wide open to the soft June day. From the window
      you could step out upon a small balcony; the balcony overhung a terrace;
      and a broad flight of steps from the terrace led down into a garden. You
      could not perceive the boundaries of the garden; in all directions it
      offered an indefinite perspective, a landscape of green lawns and shadowy
      alleys, bright parterres of flowers, fountains, and tall bending trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have spoken of the elder man and the younger, though really there could
      have been but a trifling disparity in their ages: the elder was perhaps
      thirty, the younger seven- or eight-and-twenty. In other respects,
      however, they were as unlike as unlike may be. Thirty was plump and rosy
      and full-blown, with a laughing good-humoured face, and merry big blue
      eyes; eight-and-twenty, thin, tall, and listless-looking, his face pale
      and aquiline, his eyes dark, morose. They had finished their coffee, and
      now the plump man was nibbling sweetmeats, which he selected with much
      careful discrimination from an assortment in a porcelain dish. The thin
      man was drinking something green, possibly chartreuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women are a pack of samenesses,&rdquo; he grumbled, &ldquo;and love-affairs are
      damnable iterations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried out his comrade, in a tone of plaintive protest, &ldquo;I said
      red-haired. You can&rsquo;t pretend that red-haired women are the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same, with the addition of a little henna,&rdquo; the pale young man argued
      wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may surprise you to learn that I was thinking of red-haired women who
      are born red-haired,&rdquo; his friend remarked, from an altitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I admit there is a difference&mdash;they have
      white eyelashes.&rdquo; And he emptied his glass of green stuff. &ldquo;Is all this
      apropos of boots?&rdquo; he questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other regarded him solemnly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s apropos of your immortal soul,&rdquo; he
      answered, nodding his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s medicine for a mind diseased. The only
      thing that will wake you up, and put a little life and human nature in
      you, is a love-affair with a red-haired woman. Red in the hair means fire
      in the heart. It means all sorts of things. If you really wish to please
      me, Uncle, you&rsquo;ll go and fall in love with a red-haired woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The younger man, whom the elder addressed as Uncle, shrugged his
      shoulders, and gave a little sniff. Then he lighted a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder man left the table, and went to the open window. &ldquo;Heavens, what
      weather!&rdquo; he exclaimed fervently. &ldquo;The day is made of perfumed velvet. The
      air is a love-philtre. The whole world sings romance. And yet you&mdash;insensible
      monster!&mdash;you can sit there torpidly&mdash;-&rdquo; But abruptly he fell
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      His attention had been caught by something below, in the garden. He
      watched it for an instant from his place by the window; then he stepped
      forth upon the balcony, still watching. Suddenly, facing halfway round,
      &ldquo;By my bauble, Nunky,&rdquo; he called to his companion, and his voice was tense
      with surprised exultancy, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s got red hair!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The younger man looked up with vague eyes. &ldquo;Who? What?&rdquo; he asked
      languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, come here,&rdquo; his friend urged, beckoning him. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he
      indicated, when the pale man had joined him, &ldquo;below there&mdash;to the
      right&mdash;picking roses. She&rsquo;s got red hair. She&rsquo;s sent by Providence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A woman in a white frock was picking roses, in one of the alleys of the
      garden; rather a tall woman. Her back was turned towards her observers;
      but she wore only a light scarf of lace over her head, and her hair&mdash;dim
      gold in its shadows&mdash;where the sun touched it, showed a soul of red.
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger man frowned, and asked sharply, &ldquo;Who the devil is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;One of the Queen&rsquo;s women,
      probably. But whoever she is, she&rsquo;s got red hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The younger man frowned more fiercely still. &ldquo;What is she doing in the
      King&rsquo;s private garden? This is a pretty state of things.&rdquo; He stamped his
      foot angrily. &ldquo;Go down and turn her out. And I wish measures to be taken,
      that such trespassing may not occur again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the elder man laughed. &ldquo;Hoity-toity! Calm yourself, Uncle. What would
      you have? The King is at a safe distance, hiding in one of his northern
      hunting-boxes, sulking, and nursing his spleen, as is his wont. When the
      King&rsquo;s away, the palace mice will play&mdash;at <i>lèse majesté</i>, the
      thrilling game. If you wish to stop them, persuade the King to come home
      and show his face. Otherwise, we&rsquo;ll gather our rosebuds while we may; and
      I&rsquo;m not the man to cross a red-haired woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the Constable of Bellefontaine,&rdquo; retorted his friend, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s
      your business to see that the King&rsquo;s orders are respected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s orders are so seldom respectable; and then, I&rsquo;ve a grand
      talent for neglecting my business. I&rsquo;m trying to elevate the Constableship
      of Bellefontaine into a sinecure,&rdquo; the plump man explained genially. &ldquo;But
      I&rsquo;m pained to see that your sense of humour is not escaping the general
      decay of your faculties. What you need is a love-affair with a red-haired
      woman; and yonder&rsquo;s a red-haired woman, dropped from the skies for your
      salvation. Go&mdash;engage her in talk&mdash;and fall in love with her.
      There&rsquo;s a dear,&rdquo; he pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dropped from the skies,&rdquo; the pale man repeated, with mild scorn. &ldquo;As if I
      didn&rsquo;t know my Hilary! Of course, you&rsquo;ve had her up your sleeve the whole
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my soul and honour, you are utterly mistaken. Upon my soul and
      honour, I&rsquo;ve never set eyes on her before,&rdquo; Hilary asseverated warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, if that&rsquo;s the case,&rdquo; suggested the pale man, turning back into
      the room, &ldquo;let us make an earnest endeavour to talk of something else.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he next afternoon
      they were walking in the park, at some distance from the palace, when they
      came to a bridge over a bit of artificial water; and there was the woman
      of yesterday, leaning on the parapet, throwing bread-crumbs to the carp.
      She looked up as they passed, and bowed, with a little smile, in
      acknowledgment of their raised hats.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were out of earshot, &ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; muttered Hilary, &ldquo;viewed at close
      quarters, she&rsquo;s a trifle disenchanting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; questioned his friend. &ldquo;I thought her very good-looking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has too short a nose,&rdquo; Hilary complained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of criticising particular features? The general effect of
      her face was highly pleasing. She looked intelligent, interesting; she
      looked as if she would have something to say,&rdquo; the younger man insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very possible she has a tongue in her head,&rdquo; admitted Hilary; &ldquo;but
      we were judging her by the rules of beauty. For my fancy, she&rsquo;s too tall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s tall, but she&rsquo;s well-proportioned. Indeed, her figure struck me as
      exceptionally fine. There was something sumptuous and noble about it,&rdquo;
       declared the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are scores of women with fine figures in this world,&rdquo; said Hilary.
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sorely disappointed in her hair. Her hair is nothing like so red
      as I&rsquo;d imagined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re daft on the subject of red hair. Her hair&rsquo;s not carrot-colour, if
      you come to that. But there&rsquo;s plenty of red in it, burning through it. The
      red is managed with discretion&mdash;suggestively. And did you notice her
      eyes? She has remarkably nice eyes&mdash;eyes with an expression. I
      thought her eyes and mouth were charming when she smiled,&rdquo; the pale man
      affirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When she smiled? I didn&rsquo;t see her smile,&rdquo; reflected Hilary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course she smiled&mdash;when we bowed,&rdquo; his friend reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ferdinand Augustus,&rdquo; Hilary remonstrated, &ldquo;will you never learn to
      treat words with some consideration? You call that smiling! Two men take
      off their hats, and a woman gives them just a look of bare acknowledgment;
      and Ferdinand Augustus calls it smiling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you have wished for a broad grin?&rdquo; asked Ferdinand Augustus. &ldquo;Her
      face lighted up most graciously. I thought her eyes were charming. Oh,
      she&rsquo;s certainly a good-looking woman, a distinctly handsome woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Handsome is that handsome does,&rdquo; said Hilary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I miss the relevancy of that,&rdquo; said Ferdinand Augustus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a trespasser.&rsquo;.was you yourself flew in a passion about it
      yesterday. Yesterday she was plucking the King&rsquo;s roses; to-day she&rsquo;s
      feeding the King&rsquo;s carp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;When the King&rsquo;s away, the palace mice will play.&rsquo; I venture to recall
      your own words to you,&rdquo; Ferdinand remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well. Besides, I spoke in jest. But there are limits. And
      it&rsquo;s I who am responsible. I&rsquo;m the Constable of Bellefontaine. Her
      trespassing appears to be habitual, We&rsquo;ve caught her at it ourselves, two
      days in succession. I shall give instructions to the keepers to warn her
      not to touch a flower, nor feed a bird, beast, or fish, in the whole of
      this demesne. Really, I admire the cool way in which she went on tossing
      bread-crumbs to the King&rsquo;s carp under my very beard!&rdquo; exclaimed Hilary,
      working himself into a fine state of indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely she didn&rsquo;t know who you were,&rdquo; his friend reasoned. &ldquo;And
      anyhow, your zeal is mighty sudden. You appear to have been letting things
      go at loose ends for I don&rsquo;t know how long; and all at once you take fire
      like tinder because a poor woman amuses herself by throwing bread to the
      carp. It&rsquo;s simply spite: you&rsquo;re disappointed in the colour of her hair. I
      shall esteem it a favour if you&rsquo;ll leave the keeper&rsquo;s instructions as they
      are. She&rsquo;s a damned good-looking woman; and I&rsquo;ll beg you not to interfere
      with her diversions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can deny you nothing, Uncle,&rdquo; said Hilary, by this time restored to his
      accustomed easy temper; &ldquo;and therefore she may make hay of the whole
      blessed establishment, if she pleases. But as for her good looks&mdash;that,
      you&rsquo;ll admit, is entirely a question of taste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, then the conclusion is that your taste needs cultivation,&rdquo;
       laughed Ferdinand. &ldquo;By-the-bye, I shall be glad if you will find out who
      she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; cried Hilary. &ldquo;I have a reputation to safeguard. Do
      you think I&rsquo;m going to compromise myself, and set all my underlings
      a-sniggling, by making inquiries about the identity of a woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; persisted Ferdinand, &ldquo;if I ask you to do so, as your&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; was Hilary&rsquo;s brusque interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As your guest,&rdquo; said Ferdinand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mille regrets, impossible</i>, as the French have it,&rdquo; Hilary
      returned. &ldquo;But as your host, I give you carte-blanche to make your own
      inquiries for yourself&mdash;if you think she&rsquo;s worth the trouble. Being a
      stranger here, you have, as it were, no character to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said Ferdinand Augustus, with resignation.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p>
      But the next afternoon, at about the same hour, Ferdinand Augustus found
      himself alone, strolling in the direction of the little stone bridge over
      the artificial lakelet; and there again was the woman, leaning upon the
      parapet, dropping bread-crumbs to the carp. Ferdinand Augustus raised his
      hat; the woman bowed and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine day,&rdquo; said Ferdinand Augustus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine day&mdash;but a weary one,&rdquo; the woman responded, with an odd
      little movement of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferdinand Augustus was perhaps too shy to pursue the conversation; perhaps
      he wanted but little here below, nor wanted that little long. At any rate,
      he passed on. There could be no question about her smile this time, he
      reflected; it had been bright, spontaneous, friendly. But what did she
      mean, he wondered, by adding to his general panegyric of the day as fine,
      that special qualification of it as a weary one? It was astonishing that
      any man should dispute her claim to beauty. She had really a splendid
      figure; and her face was more than pretty, it was distinguished. Her eyes
      and her mouth, her clear-grey sparkling eyes, her softly curved red mouth,
      suggested many agreeable possibilities&mdash;possibilities of wit, and of
      something else. It was not till four hours later that he noticed the sound
      of her voice. At dinner, in the midst of a discussion with Hilary about a
      subject in no obvious way connected with her (about the Orient Express,
      indeed&mdash;its safety, speed, and comfort), it suddenly came back to
      him, and he checked a remark upon the advantages of the corridor carriage,
      to exclaim in his soul, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a delicious voice. If she sang, it
      would be a mezzo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The consequence was that the following day he again bent his footsteps in
      the direction of the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lovely afternoon,&rdquo; he said, lifting his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a weary one,&rdquo; said she, smiling, with a little pensive movement of
      the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a weary one for the carp,&rdquo; he hinted, glancing down at the water,
      which boiled and bubbled with a greedy multitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they have no human feelings,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you call hunger a human feeling?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have no human feelings; but I never said we hadn&rsquo;t plenty of carp
      feelings,&rdquo; she answered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. &ldquo;At all events, I&rsquo;m pleased to find that we&rsquo;re of the same way
      of thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we?&rdquo; asked she, raising surprised eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take a healthy pessimistic view of things,&rdquo; he submitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Oh, dear, no. I have never taken a pessimistic view of anything in my
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except of this poor summer&rsquo;s afternoon, which has the fatal gift of
      beauty. You said it was a weary one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People have sympathies,&rdquo; she explained; &ldquo;and besides, that is a
      watchword.&rdquo; And she scattered a handful of crumbs, thereby exciting a new
      commotion among the carp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her explanation no doubt struck Ferdinand Augustus as obscure; but,
      perhaps he felt that he scarcely knew her well enough to press for
      enlightment. &ldquo;Let us hope that the fine weather will last,&rdquo; he said, with
      a polite salutation, and resumed his walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, on the morrow, &ldquo;You make a daily practice of casting your bread upon
      the waters,&rdquo; was his greeting to her. &ldquo;Do you expect to find it at the
      season&rsquo;s end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find it at once,&rdquo; was her response, &ldquo;in entertainment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It entertains you to see those shameless little gluttons making an
      exhibition of themselves!&rdquo; he cried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not speak disrespectfully of them,&rdquo; she reproved him. &ldquo;Some of
      them are very old. Carp often live to be two hundred, and they grow grey,
      for all the world like men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re like men in twenty particulars,&rdquo; asserted he, &ldquo;though you,
      yesterday, denied it. See how the big ones elbow the little ones aside;
      see how fierce they all are in the scramble for your bounty. You wake
      their most evil passions. But the spectacle is instructive. It&rsquo;s a
      miniature presentment of civilisation. Oh, carp are simply brimfull of
      human nature. You mentioned yesterday that they have no human feelings.
      You put your finger on the chief point of resemblance. It&rsquo;s the absence of
      human feeling that makes them so hideously human.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with eyes that were interested, amused, yet not
      altogether without a shade of raillery in their depths. &ldquo;That is what you
      call a healthy pessimistic view of things?&rdquo; she questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an inevitable view if one honestly uses one&rsquo;s sight, or reads one&rsquo;s
      newspaper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then I would rather not honestly use my sight,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;and as for
      the newspaper, I only read the fashions. Your healthy pessimistic view of
      things can hardly add much to the joy of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The joy of life!&rdquo;. he expostulated. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no joy in life. Life is one
      fabric of hardship, peril, and insipidity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how can you say that,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;in the face of such beauty as we
      have about us here? With the pure sky and the sunshine, and the wonderful
      peace of the day; and then these lawns and glades and the great green
      trees; and the sweet air, and the singing birds! No joy in life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t life,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;People who shut themselves up in an
      artificial park are fugitives from life. Life begins at the park gates,
      with the natural countryside, and the squalid peasantry, and the sordid
      farmers, and the Jew money-lenders, and the uncertain crops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all life,&rdquo; insisted she, &ldquo;the park and the countryside, and the
      virgin forest and the deep sea, with all things in them. It&rsquo;s all life.
      I&rsquo;m alive, and I daresay you are. You would exclude from life all that is
      nice in life, and then say of the remainder, that only is life. You&rsquo;re not
      logical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid,&rdquo; he murmured devoutly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re not, either. Only
      stupid people are logical.&rdquo; She laughed lightly. &ldquo;My poor carp little
      dream to what far paradoxes they have led,&rdquo; she mused, looking into the
      water, which was now quite tranquil. &ldquo;They have sailed away to their
      mysterious affairs among the lily-roots. I should like to be a carp for a
      few minutes, to see what it is like in those cool, dark places under the
      water. I am sure there are all sorts of strange things and treasures. Do
      you believe there are really water-maidens, like Undine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not nowadays,&rdquo; he informed her, with the confident fluency of one who
      knew. &ldquo;There used to be; but, like so many other charming things, they
      disappeared with the invention of printing, the discovery of America, and
      the rise of the Lutheran heresy. Their prophetic souls&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but they had no souls, you remember,&rdquo; she corrected him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon; that was the belief that prevailed among their mortal
      contemporaries, but it has since been ascertained that they had souls, and
      very good ones. Their prophetic souls warned them what a dreary, dried-up
      planet the earth was destined to become, with the steam-engine, the
      electric telegraph, compulsory education (falsely so called),
      constitutional government, and the supremacy of commerce. So the elder
      ones died, dissolved in tears; and the younger ones migrated by
      evaporation to Neptune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, dear me,&rdquo; she marvelled. &ldquo;How extraordinary that we should just
      have happened to light upon a topic about which you appear to have such a
      quantity of special knowledge! And now,&rdquo; she added, bending her head by
      way of valediction, &ldquo;I must be returning to my duties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she moved off, towards the palace.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nd then, for three
      or four days, he did not see her, though he paid frequent enough visits to
      the feeding-place of the carp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it would rain,&rdquo; he confessed to Hilary. &ldquo;I hate the derisive
      cheerfulness of this weather. The birds sing, and the flowers smile, and
      every prospect breathes sodden satisfaction; and only man is bored.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I own I find you dull company,&rdquo; Hilary responded, &ldquo;and if I thought
      it would brisk you up, I&rsquo;d pray with all my heart for rain. But what you
      need, as I&rsquo;ve told you a thousand times, is a love-affair with a
      red-haired woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love-affairs are tedious repetitions,&rdquo; said Ferdinand. &ldquo;You play with
      your new partner precisely the same game you played with the old: the same
      preliminary skirmishes, the same assault, the same feints of resistance,
      the same surrender, the same subsequent disenchantment. They&rsquo;re all the
      same, down to the very same scenes, words, gestures, suspicions, vows,
      exactions, recriminations, and final break-ups. It&rsquo;s a delusion of
      inexperience to suppose that in changing your mistress you change the
      sport. It&rsquo;s the same trite old book, that you&rsquo;ve read and read in
      different editions, until you&rsquo;re sick of the very mention of it. To the
      deuce with love-affairs. But there&rsquo;s such a thing as rational
      conversation, with no sentimental nonsense. Now, I&rsquo;ll not deny that I
      should rather like to have an occasional bit of rational conversation with
      that red-haired woman we met the other day in the park. Only, the devil of
      it is, she never appears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, besides, her hair isn&rsquo;t red,&rdquo; added Hilary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder how you can talk such folly,&rdquo; said Ferdinand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est mon métier</i>, Uncle. You should answer me! according to it.
      Her hair&rsquo;s not red. What little red there&rsquo;s in it, it requires strong
      sunlight to bring out. In shadow her hair&rsquo;s a sort of dull
      brownish-yellow,&rdquo; Hilary persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re colour-blind,&rdquo; retorted Ferdinand. &ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t quarrel with you.
      The point is, she never appears. So how can I have my bits of rational
      conversation with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, indeed?&rdquo; echoed Hilary, with pathos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And therefore you&rsquo;re invoking storm and whirlwind. But hang a horseshoe
      over your bed to-night, turn round three times as you extinguish your
      candle, and let your last thought before you fall asleep be the thought of
      a newt&rsquo;s liver and a blind man&rsquo;s dog; and it&rsquo;s highly possible she will
      appear to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t know whether Ferdinand Augustus accomplished the rites that Hilary
      prescribed, but it is certain that she did appear on the morrow: not by
      the pool of the carp, but in quite another region of Bellefontaine, where
      Ferdinand Augustus was wandering at hazard, somewhat disconsolately. There
      was a wide green meadow, sprinkled with buttercups and daisies; and under
      a great tree, at this end of it, he suddenly espied her. She was seated on
      the moss, stroking with one finger-tip a cockchafer that was perched upon
      another, and regarding the little monster with intent meditative eyes. She
      wore a frock the bodice part of which was all drooping creamy lace; she
      had thrown her hat and gloves aside; her hair was in some slight, soft
      disarray; her loose sleeve had fallen back, disclosing a very perfect
      wrist and the beginning of a smooth white arm. Altogether she made an
      extremely pleasing picture, sweetly, warmly feminine. Ferdinand Augustus
      stood still, and watched her for an instant before he spoke. Then&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to intercede with you on behalf of your carp,&rdquo; he announced.
      &ldquo;They are rending heaven with complaints of your desertion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up, with a whimsical, languid little smile. &ldquo;Are they?&rdquo; she
      asked lightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather tired of carp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head sorrowfully. &ldquo;You will permit me to admire your fine,
      frank disregard of <i>their</i> feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they have the past to remember,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And perhaps some day I
      shall go back to them. For the moment I amuse myself very well with
      cockchafers. They&rsquo;re less tumultuous. And then, carp won&rsquo;t come and perch
      on your finger. And then, one likes a change.&mdash;Now fly away, fly
      away, fly away home; your house is on fire, and your children will burn,&rdquo;
       she crooned to the cockchafer, giving it never so gentle a push. But
      instead of flying away, it dropped upon the moss, and thence began to
      stumble, clumsily, blunderingly, towards the open meadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have caused the poor beast such a panic,&rdquo; he reproached
      her. &ldquo;You should have broken the dreadful news gradually. As you see, your
      sudden blurting of it out has deprived him of the use of his faculties.
      Don&rsquo;t believe her,&rdquo; he called after the cockchafer. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s practising upon
      your credulity. Your house isn&rsquo;t on fire, and your children are all safe
      at school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your consideration is entirely misplaced,&rdquo; she assured him, with the same
      slight whimsical smile. &ldquo;The cockchafer knows perfectly well that his
      house isn&rsquo;t on fire, because he hasn&rsquo;t got any house. Cockchafers never
      have houses. His apparent concern is sheer affectation. He&rsquo;s an
      exceedingly hypocritical little cockchafer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should call him an exceedingly polite little cockchafer. Hypocrisy is
      the compliment courtesy owes to falsehood. He pretended to believe you. He
      would not have the air of doubting a lady&rsquo;s word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You came as the emissary of the carp,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and now you stay to
      defend the character of their rival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be candid, I don&rsquo;t care a hang for the carp,&rdquo; he confessed brazenly.
      &ldquo;The unadorned fact is that I&rsquo;m immensely glad to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave a little laugh, and bowed with exaggerated ceremony. &ldquo;<i>Grand
      merci, Monsieur; vous me faites trop d&rsquo;honneur</i>,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, not more than you deserve. I&rsquo;m a just man, and I give you your
      due. I was boring myself into melancholy madness. The afternoon lay before
      me like a bumper of dust and ashes, that I must somehow empty. And then I
      saw you, and you dashed the goblet from my lips. Thank goodness (I said to
      myself), at last there&rsquo;s a human soul to talk with; the very thing I was
      pining for, a clever and sympathetic woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take a great deal for granted,&rdquo; laughed she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know you&rsquo;re clever, and it pleases me to fancy that you&rsquo;re
      sympathetic. If you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t tell me so. Let me cherish
      my illusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head doubtfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a poor hand at dissembling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an art you should study,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If we begin by feigning an
      emotion, we&rsquo;re as like as not to end by genuinely feeling it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve observed for myself,&rdquo; she informed him, &ldquo;that if we begin by
      genuinely feeling an emotion, but rigorously conceal it, we&rsquo;re as like as
      not to end by feeling it no longer. It dies of suffocation. I&rsquo;ve had that
      experience quite lately. There was a certain person whom I heartily
      despised and hated; and then, as chance would have it, I was thrown two or
      three times into his company; and for motives of expediency I disguised my
      antagonism. In the end, do you know, I found myself rather liking him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, women are fearfully and wonderfully made,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so are some men,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Could you oblige me with the name and
      address of a competent witch or warlock?&rdquo; she added irrelevantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What under the sun can you want with such an unholy thing?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a hate-charm&mdash;something that I can take at night to revive my
      hatred of the man I was speaking of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he warned her, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not come all this distance, under a
      scorching sun, to stand here now and talk of another man. Cultivate a
      contemptuous indifference towards him. Banish him from your mind and
      conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; she consented; &ldquo;though, if you were familiar with the
      circumstances, you&rsquo;d recognise a certain difficulty in doing that.&rdquo; She
      reached for her gloves, and began to put one on. &ldquo;Will you be so good as
      to tell me the time of day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at his watch. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nowhere near time for you to be moving yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not trifle about affairs of state,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;At a definite
      hour I have business at the palace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for that matter, so have I. But it&rsquo;s half-past four. To call
      half-past four a definite hour would be to do a violence to the language.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is earlier than I thought,&rdquo; she admitted, discontinuing her operation
      with the glove.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled approval. &ldquo;Your heart is in the right place, after all. It would
      have been inhuman to abandon me. Oh, yes, pleasantry apart, I am in a
      condition of mind in which solitude spells misery. And yet I am on
      speaking terms with but three living people whose society I prefer to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are indeed in sad case, then,&rdquo; she compassionated him. &ldquo;But why
      should solitude spell misery? A man of wit like you should have plenty of
      resources within himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I a man of wit?&rdquo; he asked innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes gleamed mischievously. &ldquo;What is your opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;Perhaps I might have been, if I had met a
      woman like you earlier in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;if you are not a man of wit, it is not for
      lack of courage. But why does solitude spell misery? Have you great crimes
      upon your conscience?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nothing so amusing. But when one is alone, one thinks; and when one
      thinks&mdash;that way madness lies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do you never think when you are engaged in conversation?&rdquo; She raised
      her eyebrows questioningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should be able to judge of that by the quality of my remarks. At any
      rate, I feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you feel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I am engaged in conversation with you, I feel a general sense of
      agreeable stimulation; and, in addition to that, at this particular moment&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But
      are you sure you really wish to know?&rdquo; he broke off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, tell me,&rdquo; she said, with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, a furious desire to smoke a cigarette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed merrily. &ldquo;I am so sorry I have no cigarettes to offer you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My pockets happen to be stuffed with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, do, please, light one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He produced his cigarette-case, but he seemed to hesitate about lighting a
      cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you no matches?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thank you, I have matches. I was only thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has become a solitude, then?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a case of conscience, it is an ethical dilemma. How do I know&mdash;the
      modern woman is capable of anything&mdash;how do I know that you may not
      yourself be a smoker? But if you are, it will give you pain to see me
      enjoying my cigarette, while you are without one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be civil to begin by offering me one,&rdquo; she suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is exactly the liberty I dared not take&mdash;oh, there are limits
      to my boldness. But you have saved the situation.&rdquo; And he offered her his
      cigarette-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;Thank you, I don&rsquo;t smoke.&rdquo; And her eyes were full of
      teasing laughter, so that he laughed too, as he finally applied a
      match-flame to his cigarette. &ldquo;But you may allow me to examine your
      cigarette-case,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;It looks like a pretty bit of silver.&rdquo; And
      when he had handed it to her, she exclaimed, &ldquo;It is engraved with the
      royal arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Why not?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it belong to the King?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a present from the King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To you? You are a friend of the King?&rdquo; she asked, with some eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not deceive you,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;No, not to me. The King gave it to
      Hilary Clairevoix, the Constable of Bellefontaine; and Hilary, who&rsquo;s a
      careless fellow, left it lying about in his music-room, and I came along
      and pocketed it. It is a pretty bit of silver, and I shall never restore
      it to its rightful owner if I can help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are a friend of the King&rsquo;s?&rdquo; she repeated, with insistence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not that honour. Indeed, I have never seen him. I am a friend of
      Hilary&rsquo;s; I am his guest. He has stayed with me in England&mdash;I am an
      Englishman&mdash;and now I am returning his visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;If you were a friend of the King, you would be
      an enemy of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; he wondered. &ldquo;Why is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate the King,&rdquo; she answered simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, what a capacity you have for hating! This is the second hatred
      you have avowed within the hour. What has the King done to displease you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an Englishman. Has the King&rsquo;s reputation not reached England yet?
      He is the scandal of Europe. What has he done? But no&mdash;do not
      encourage me to speak of him. I should grow too heated,&rdquo; she said
      strenuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I pray of you, go on,&rdquo; urged Ferdinand Augustus. &ldquo;Your
      King is a character that interests me more than you can think. His
      reputation has indeed reached England, and I have conceived a great
      curiosity about him. One only hears vague rumours, to be sure, nothing
      specific; but one has learned to think of him as original and romantic.
      You know him. Tell me a lot about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I do not know him personally. That is an affliction I have as yet
      been spared.&rdquo; Then, suddenly, &ldquo;Mercy upon me, what have I said!&rdquo; she
      cried. &ldquo;I must &rsquo;knock wood,&rsquo; or the evil spirits will bring me that
      mischance to-morrow.&rdquo; And she fervently tapped the bark of the tree beside
      her with her knuckles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferdinand Augustus laughed. &ldquo;But if you do not know him personally, why do
      you hate him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know him very well by reputation. I know how he lives, I know what he
      does and leaves undone. If you are curious about him, ask your friend
      Hilary. He is the King&rsquo;s foster-brother. <i>He</i> could tell you
      stories,&rdquo; she added meaningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have asked him. But Hilary&rsquo;s lips are sealed. He depends upon the
      King&rsquo;s protection for his fortune, and the palace-walls (I suppose he
      fears) have ears. But you can speak without danger. He is the scandal of
      Europe? There&rsquo;s nothing I love like scandal. Tell me all about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not come all this distance, under a scorching sun, to stand here
      now and talk of another man,&rdquo; she reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but kings are different,&rdquo; he argued. &ldquo;Tell me about your King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you at once,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that our King is the frankest egotist
      in two hemispheres. You have learned to think of him as original and
      romantic? No; he is simply intensely selfish and intensely silly. He is a
      King Do-Nothing, a Roi Fainéant, who shirks and evades all the duties and
      responsibilities of his position; who builds extravagant chateaux in
      remote parts of the country, and hides in them, alone with a few obscure
      companions; who will never visit his capital, never show his face to his
      subjects; who takes no sort of interest in public business or the welfare
      of his kingdom, and leaves the entire government to his ministers; who
      will not even hold a court, or give balls or banquets; who, in short, does
      nothing that a king ought to do, and might, for all the good we get of
      him, be a mere stranger in the land, a mere visitor, like yourself. So
      closely does he seclude himself that I doubt if there be a hundred people
      in the whole country who have ever seen him, to know him. If he travels
      from one place to another, it is always in the strictest incognito, and
      those who then chance to meet him never have any reason to suspect that he
      is not a private person. His very effigy on the coin of the realm is
      reputed to be false, resembling him in no wise. But I could go on for
      ever,&rdquo; she said, bringing her indictment to a termination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said Ferdinand Augustus, &ldquo;I cannot see that you have alleged
      anything very damaging. A Roi Fainéant? But every king of a modern
      constitutional state is, willy-nilly, that. He can do nothing but sign
      bills which he generally disapproves of, lay foundation-stones, set the
      fashion in hats, and bow and look pleasant as he drives through the
      streets. He has no power for good, and mighty little for evil. He is just
      a State Prisoner. It seems to me that your particular King has shown some
      sense in trying to escape so much as he may of the prison&rsquo;s irksomeness. I
      should call it rare bad luck to be born a king. Either you&rsquo;ve got to shirk
      your kingship, and then fair ladies dub you the scandal of Europe; or else
      you&rsquo;ve got to accept it, and then you&rsquo;re as happy as a man in a
      strait-waistcoat. And then, and then! Oh, I can think of a thousand
      unpleasantnesses attendant upon the condition of a king. Your King, as I
      understand it, has said to himself, &rsquo;Hang it all, I didn&rsquo;t ask to be born
      a king, but since that is my misfortune, I will seek to mitigate it as
      much as I am able. I am, on the whole, a human being, with a human life to
      live, and only, probably, threescore-and-ten years in which to live it.
      Very good; I will live my life. I will lay no foundation-stones, nor drive
      about the streets bowing and looking pleasant. I will live my life, alone
      with the few people I find to my liking. I will take the cash and let the
      credit go.&rsquo; I am bound to say,&rdquo; concluded Ferdinand Augustus, &ldquo;that your
      King has done exactly what I should have done in his place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will never, at least,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;defend the shameful manner in which
      he has behaved towards the Queen. It is for that, I hate him. It is for
      that, that we, the Queen&rsquo;s gentlewomen, have adopted &rsquo;7&rsquo; is a weary day as
      a watchword. It will be a weary day until we see the King on his knees at
      the Queen&rsquo;s feet, craving her forgiveness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh? What has he done to the Queen?&rdquo; asked Ferdinand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has he done! Humiliated her as never woman was humiliated before. He
      married her by proxy at her father&rsquo;s court; and she was conducted with
      great pomp and circumstance into his kingdom&mdash;to find what? That he
      had fled to one of his absurd castles in the north, and refused to see
      her! He has remained there ever since, hiding like&mdash;but there is
      nothing in created space to compare him to. Is it the behaviour of a
      gentleman, of a gallant man, not to say a king?&rdquo; she cried warmly, looking
      up at him with shining eyes, her cheeks faintly flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferdinand Augustus bowed. &ldquo;The Queen is fortunate in her advocate. I have
      not heard the King&rsquo;s side of the story. I can, however, imagine excuses
      for him. Suppose that his ministers, for reasons of policy, importuned and
      importuned him to marry a certain princess, until he yielded in mere
      fatigue. In that case, why should he be bothered further? Why should he
      add one to the tedious complications of existence by meeting the bride he
      never desired? Is it not sufficient that, by his complaisance, she should
      have gained the rank and title of a queen? Besides, he may be in love with
      another woman. Or perhaps&mdash;but who can tell? He may have twenty
      reasons. And anyhow, you cannot deny to the situation the merit of being
      highly ridiculous. A husband and wife who are not personally acquainted!
      It is a delicious commentary upon the whole system of marriages by proxy.
      You confirm my notion that your King is original.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may have twenty reasons,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;but he had better have twenty
      terrors. It is perfectly certain that the Queen will be revenged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked Ferdinand Augustus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Queen is young, high-spirited, moderately good-looking, and
      unspeakably incensed. Trust a young, high-spirited, and handsome woman,
      outraged by her husband, to know how to avenge herself. Oh, some day he
      will see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, he must take his chances,&rdquo; Ferdinand sighed. &ldquo;Perhaps he is
      liberal-minded enough not to care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am far from meaning the vulgar revenge you fancy,&rdquo; she put in quickly.
      &ldquo;The Queen&rsquo;s revenge will be subtle and unexpected. She is no fool, and
      she will not rest until she has achieved it. Oh, he will see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had imagined it was the curse of royalty to be without true friends,&rdquo;
       said Ferdinand Augustus. &ldquo;The Queen has a very ardent one in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I cannot altogether acquit myself of interested motives,&rdquo; she
      disclaimed modestly. &ldquo;I am of her Majesty&rsquo;s household, and my fortunes
      must rise and fall with hers. But I am honestly indignant with the King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor King! Upon my soul, he has my sympathy,&rdquo; said Ferdinand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are terribly ironical,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Irony was ten thousand leagues from my intention,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;In all
      sincerity the object of your indignation has my sympathy. I trust you will
      not consider it an impertinence if I say that I already count you among
      the few people I have met whose good opinion is a matter to be coveted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had risen while he was speaking, and now she bobbed him a little
      curtsey. &ldquo;I will show my appreciation of yours, by taking flight before
      anything can happen to alter it,&rdquo; she laughed, moving away.
    </p>
    <h3>
      V
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are singularly animated to-night,&rdquo; said Hilary, contemplating him
      across the dinner-table; &ldquo;yet, at the same time, singularly abstracted.
      You have the air of a man who is rolling something pleasant under his
      tongue, something sweet and secret: it might be a hope, it might be a
      recollection. Where have you passed the afternoon? You&rsquo;ve been about some
      mischief, I&rsquo;ll warrant. By Jove, you set me thinking. I&rsquo;ll wager a penny
      you&rsquo;ve been having a bit of rational conversation with that brown-haired
      woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her hair is red,&rdquo; Ferdinand Augustus rejoined, with firmness. &ldquo;And her
      conversation,&rdquo; he added sadly, &ldquo;is anything you please but rational. She
      spent her whole time picking flaws in the character of the King. She
      talked downright treason. She said he was the scandal of Europe and the
      frankest egotist in two hemispheres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah? She appears to have some instinct for the correct use of language,&rdquo;
       commented Hilary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same, I rather like her,&rdquo; Ferdinand went on, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m half
      inclined to undertake her conversion. She has a gorgeous figure&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      something rich and voluptuous about it. And there are depths of promise in
      her eyes; there are worlds of humour and of passion. And she has a mouth&mdash;oh,
      of a fulness, of a softness, of a warmth! And a chin, and a throat, and
      hands! And then, her voice. There&rsquo;s a mellowness yet a crispness, there&rsquo;s
      a vibration, there&rsquo;s a something in her voice that assures you of a golden
      temperament beneath it. In short, I&rsquo;m half inclined to follow your advice,
      and go in for a love-adventure with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but love-adventures&mdash;I have it on high authority&mdash;are
      damnable iterations,&rdquo; objected Hilary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very true; they are,&rdquo; Ferdinand agreed. &ldquo;But the life of man is
      woven of damnable iterations. Tell me of any single thing that isn&rsquo;t a
      damnable iteration, and I&rsquo;ll give you a quarter of my fortune. The day and
      the night, the seasons and the years, the fair weather and the foul,
      breakfast and luncheon and dinner&mdash;all are damnable iterations. If
      there&rsquo;s any reality behind the doctrine of metempsychosis, death, too, is
      a damnable iteration. There&rsquo;s no escaping damnable iterations: there&rsquo;s
      nothing new under the sun. But as long as one is alive, one must do
      something. It&rsquo;s sure to be something in its essence identical with
      something one has done before; but one must do something. Why not, then, a
      love-adventure with a woman that attracts you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women are a pack of samenesses,&rdquo; said Hilary despondently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; assented Ferdinand. &ldquo;Women, and men too, are a pack of
      samenesses. We&rsquo;re all struck with the same die, of the same metal, at the
      same mint. Our resemblance is intrinsic, fundamental; our differences are
      accidental and skin deep. We have the same features, organs, dimensions,
      with but a hair&rsquo;s-breadth variation; the same needs, instincts,
      propensities; the same hopes, fears, ideas. One man&rsquo;s meat is another
      man&rsquo;s meat; one man&rsquo;s poison is another man&rsquo;s poison. We are as like to
      one another as the leaves on the same tree. Skin us, and (save for your
      fat) the most skilled anatomist could never distinguish you from me. Women
      are a pack of samenesses; but, hang it all, one has got to make the best
      of a monotonous universe. And this particular woman, with her red hair and
      her eyes, strikes me as attractive. She has some fire in her composition,
      some fire and flavour. Anyhow, she attracts me; and&mdash;I think I shall
      try my luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Nunky, Nunky,&rdquo; murmured Hilary, shaking his head, &ldquo;I am shocked by
      your lack of principle. Have you forgotten that you are a married man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be my safeguard. I can make love to her with a clear
      conscience. If I were single, she might, justifiably enough, form
      matrimonial expectations for herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if she knew you,&rdquo; said Hilary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but she doesn&rsquo;t know me&mdash;and shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Ferdinand Augustus.
      &ldquo;I will take care of that.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nd then, for what
      seemed to him an eternity, he never once encountered her. Morning and
      afternoon, day after day, he roamed the park of Bellefontaine from end to
      end, in all directions, but never once caught sight of so much as the
      flutter of her garments. And the result was that he began to grow
      seriously sentimental. &ldquo;<i>Im wunderschônen Monat Mai!</i>&rdquo; It was June,
      to be sure; but the meteorological influences were, for that, only the
      more potent. He remembered her shining eyes now as not merely whimsical
      and ardent, but as pensive, appealing, tender; he remembered her face as a
      face seen in starlight, ethereal and mystic; and her voice as low music
      far away. He recalled their last meeting as a treasure he had possessed
      and lost; he blamed himself for the frivolity of his talk and manner, and
      for the ineffectual impression of him this must have left upon her.
      Perpetually thinking of her, he was perpetually sighing, perpetually
      suffering strange, sudden, half painful, half delicious commotions in the
      tissues of his heart. Every morning he rose with a replenished fund of
      hope: this day at last would produce her. Every night he went to bed
      pitying himself as bankrupt of hope. And all the while, though he pined to
      talk of her, a curious bashfulness withheld him; so that, between him and
      Hilary, for quite a fortnight she was not mentioned. It was Hilary who
      broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so pale and wan?&rdquo; Hilary asked him. &ldquo;Will, when looking well won&rsquo;t
      move her, looking ill prevail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am seriously love-sick,&rdquo; cried Ferdinand Augustus, welcoming the
      subject. &ldquo;I went in for a sensation, and I&rsquo;ve got a real emotion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor youth! And she won&rsquo;t look at you, I suppose?&rdquo; was Hilary&rsquo;s method of
      commiseration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not seen her for a mortal fortnight. She has completely vanished.
      And for the first time in my life I&rsquo;m seriously in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re incapable of being seriously in love,&rdquo; said Hilary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had always thought so myself,&rdquo; admitted Ferdinand Augustus. &ldquo;The most I
      had ever felt for any woman was a sort of mere lukewarm desire, a sort of
      mere meaningless titillation. But this woman is different. She&rsquo;s as
      different to other women as wine is different to toast-and-water. She has
      the <i>feu-sacré</i>. She&rsquo;s done something to the very inmost soul of me;
      she&rsquo;s laid it bare, and set it quivering and yearning. She&rsquo;s made herself
      indispensable to me; I can&rsquo;t live without her. Ah, you don&rsquo;t know what
      she&rsquo;s like. She&rsquo;s like some strange, beautiful, burning spirit. Oh, for an
      hour with her I&rsquo;d give my kingdom. To touch her hand&mdash;to look into
      those eyes of hers&mdash;to hear her speak to me! I tell you squarely, if
      she&rsquo;d have me, I&rsquo;d throw up the whole scheme of my existence, I&rsquo;d fly with
      her to the uttermost ends of the earth. But she has totally disappeared,
      and I can do nothing to recover her without betraying my identity; and
      that would spoil everything. I want her to love me for myself, believing
      me to be a plain man, like you or anybody. If she knew who I am, how could
      I ever be sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>are</i> in a bad way,&rdquo; said Hilary, looking at him with amusement.
      &ldquo;And yet, I&rsquo;m gratified to see it. Her hair is not so red as I could wish,
      but, after all, it&rsquo;s reddish; and you appear to be genuinely aflame. It
      will do you no end of good; it will make a man of you&mdash;a plain man,
      like me or anybody. But your impatience is not reasoned. A fortnight? You
      have not met her for a fortnight? My dear, to a plain man (like me or
      anybody) a fortnight&rsquo;s nothing. It&rsquo;s just an appetiser. Watch and wait,
      and you&rsquo;ll meet her before you know it. And now, if you will excuse me, I
      have business in another quarter of the palace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferdinand Augustus, left to himself, went down into the garden. It was a
      wonderful summer&rsquo;s evening, made indeed (if I may steal a phrase from
      Hilary) of perfumed velvet. The sun had set an hour since, but the western
      sky was still splendid, like a dark banner, with sombre reds and purples;
      and in the east hung the full moon, so brilliant, so apposite, as to seem
      somehow almost like a piece of premeditated decoration. The waters of the
      fountains flashed silverly in its light; glossy leaves gave back dim
      reflections; here and there, embowered among the trees, white statues
      gleamed ghost-like. Away in the park somewhere, innumerable frogs were
      croaking, croaking; subdued by distance, the sound gained a quality that
      was plaintive and unearthly. The long façade of the palace lay obscure in
      shadow; only at the far end, in the Queen&rsquo;s apartments, were the windows
      alight. But, quite close at hand, the moon caught a corner of the terrace;
      and here, presently, Ferdinand Augustus became aware of a human figure. A
      woman was standing alone by the balustrade, gazing out into the wondrous
      night. Ferdinand Augustus&rsquo;s heart began to pound; and it was a full minute
      before he could command himself sufficiently to move or speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, however, he approached her. &ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; he said, looking up
      from the pathway.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced down at him, leaning upon the balustrade. &ldquo;Oh, how do you do?&rdquo;
       She smiled her surprise. She was in evening dress, a white robe
      embroidered with pearls, and she wore a tiara of pearls in her hair. She
      had a light cloak thrown over her shoulders, a little cape trimmed with
      swan&rsquo;s-down. &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; thought Ferdinand Augustus. &ldquo;How magnificent she
      is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hundred years since I have seen you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is it so long as that? I should have imagined it was something like a
      fortnight. Time passes quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a question of psychology. But now at last I find you when I least
      expect you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have slipped out for a moment,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;to enjoy this beautiful
      prospect. One has no such view from the Queen&rsquo;s end of the terrace. One
      cannot see the moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot see the moon from where I am standing,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, because you have turned your back upon it,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have chosen between two visions. If you were to authorise me to join
      you, aloft there, I could see both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no power to authorise you,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;the terrace is not my
      property. But if you choose to take the risks&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you are good, you are kind.&rdquo; And in an instant he had
      joined her on the terrace, and his heart was fluttering wildly with its
      sense of her nearness to him. He could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now you can see the moon. Is it all your fancy painted?&rdquo; she asked,
      with her whimsical smile. Her face was exquisitely pale in the moonlight,
      her eyes glowed. Her voice was very soft.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart was fluttering wildly, poignantly. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he began, but broke
      off. His breath trembled. &ldquo;I cannot speak,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She arched her eyebrows; &ldquo;Then we have made some mistake. This will never
      be you, in that case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, it is I. It is the other fellow, the gabbler, who is not
      myself,&rdquo; he contrived to tell her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lead a double life, like the villain in the play?&rdquo; she suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have your laugh at my expense; have it, and welcome. But I know
      what I know,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know?&rdquo; she asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that I am in love with you,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, only that,&rdquo; she said, with an air of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that. But that is a great deal. I know that I love you&mdash;oh,
      yes, unutterably. If you could see yourself! You are absolutely unique
      among women. I would never have believed it possible for any woman to make
      me feel what you have made me feel. I have never spoken like this to any
      woman in all my life. Oh, you may laugh. It is the truth, upon my word of
      honour. If you could look into your eyes&mdash;yes, even when you are
      laughing at me! I can see your wonderful burning spirit shining deep, deep
      in your eyes. You do not dream how different you are to other women. You
      are a wonderful burning poem. They are platitudes. Oh, I love you
      unutterably. There has not been an hour since I last saw you that I have
      not thought of you, loved you, longed for you. And now here you stand, you
      yourself, beside me! If you could see into my heart, if you could see what
      I feel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the moon, with a strange little smile, and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not speak to me?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you have me say?&rdquo; she asked, still looking away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you know, you know what I would have you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you will not like the only thing I can say.&rdquo; She turned, and
      met his eyes. &ldquo;I am a married woman, and&mdash;I am in love with my
      husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferdinand Augustus stood aghast. &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; he groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, though he has given me little enough reason to do so, I have fallen
      in love with him,&rdquo; she went on pitilessly. &ldquo;So you must get over your
      fancy for me. After all, I am a total stranger to you. You do not even
      know my name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you tell me your name?&rdquo; asked Ferdinand humbly. &ldquo;It will be
      something to remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Marguerite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marguerite! Marguerite!&rdquo; He repeated it caressingly. &ldquo;It is a beautiful
      name. But it is also the name of the Queen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the only person named Marguerite in the Queen&rsquo;s court,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Ferdinand Augustus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is a wise husband who knows his own wife,&rdquo; laughed she.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then.... But I think I have told enough.

      THE FRIEND OF MAN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he other evening,
      in the Casino, the satisfaction of losing my money at petits-chevaux
      having begun to flag a little, I wandered into the Cercle, the reserved
      apartments in the west wing of the building, where they were playing
      baccarat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to the heat, the windows were open wide; and through them one could
      see, first, a vivid company of men and women, strolling backwards and
      forwards, and chattering busily, in the electric glare on the terrace; and
      then, beyond them, the sea&mdash;smooth, motionless, sombre; silent,
      despite its perpetual whisper; inscrutable, sinister; merging itself with
      the vast blackness of space. Here and there the black was punctured by a
      pin-point of fire, a tiny vacillating pin-point of fire; and a landsman&rsquo;s
      heart quailed for a moment at the thought of lonely vessels braving the
      mysteries and terrors and the awful solitudes of the sea at night....
    </p>
    <p>
      So that the voice of the croupier, perfunctory, machine-like, had almost a
      human, almost a genial effect, as it rapped out suddenly, calling upon the
      players to mark their play. &ldquo;Marquez vos jeux, messieurs. Quarante louis
      par tableau.&rdquo; It brought one back to light and warmth and security, to the
      familiar earth, and the neighbourhood of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      One&rsquo;s pleasure was fugitive, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      The neighbourhood of men, indeed! The neighbourhood of some two score very
      commonplace, very sordid men, seated or standing about an ugly green
      table, intent upon a game of baccarat, in a long, rectangular, ugly,
      gas-lit room. The banker dealt, and the croupier shouted, and the punters
      punted, and the ivory counters and mother-of-pearl plaques were swept now
      here, now there; and that was all. Everybody was smoking, of course; but
      the smell of the live cigarettes couldn&rsquo;t subdue the odour of dead ones,
      the stagnant, acrid odour of stale tobacco, with which the walls and
      hangings of the place were saturated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing and the people were as banale, as unremunerative, as things and
      people for the most part are; and dispiriting, dispiriting. There was a
      hardness in the banality, a sort of cold ferocity, ill-repressed. One
      turned away, bored, revolted. It was better, after all, to look at the
      sea; to think of the lonely vessel, far out there, where a pin-point of
      fire still faintly blinked and glimmered in the illimitable darkness....
    </p>
    <p>
      But the voice of the croupier was insistent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faites vos jeux, messieurs. Cinquante louis par tableau. Vos jeux sont
      faits? Rien ne va plus.&rdquo; It was suggestive, persuasive, besides, to one
      who has a bit of a gambler&rsquo;s soul. I saw myself playing, I felt the
      poignant tremor of the instant of suspense, while the result is uncertain,
      the glow that comes if you have won, the twinge if you have lost. &ldquo;La
      banque est aux enchères,&rdquo; the voice announced presently; and I moved
      towards the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sums bid were not extravagant. Ten, fifteen, twenty louis; thirty,
      fifty, eighty, a hundred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cent louis? Cent? Cent?&mdash;Cent louis à la banque,&rdquo; cried the
      inevitable voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I glanced at the man who had taken the bank for a hundred louis. I glanced
      at him, and, all at once, by no means without emotion, I recognised him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a tall, thin man, and very old. He had the hands of a very old man,
      dried-up, shrunken hands, with mottled-yellow skin, dark veins that stood
      out like wires, and parched finger-nails. His face, too, was
      mottled-yellow, deepening to brown about the eyes, with grey wrinkles, and
      purplish lips. He was clearly very old; eighty, or more than eighty.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was dressed entirely in black: a black frock-coat, black trousers, a
      black waistcoat, cut low, and exposing an unusual quantity of shirt-front,
      three black studs, and a black tie, a stiff, narrow bow. These latter
      details, however, save when some chance motion on his part revealed them,
      were hidden by his beard, a broad, abundant beard, that fell a good ten
      inches down his breast. His hair, also, was abundant, and he wore it long;
      trained straight back from his forehead, hanging in a fringe about the
      collar of his coat. Hair and beard, despite his manifest great age, were
      without a spear of white. They were of a dry, inanimate brown, a hue to
      which they had faded (one surmised) from black.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it was surprising to see so old a man at a baccarat table, it was still
      more surprising to see just this sort of man. He looked like anything in
      the world, rather than a gambler. With his tall wasted figure, with his
      patriarchal beard, his long hair trained in that rigid fashion straight
      back from his forehead; with his stern aquiline profile, his dark eyes,
      deep-set and wide-apart, melancholy, thoughtful: he looked&mdash;what
      shall I say? He looked like anything in the world, rather than a gambler.
      He looked like a <i>savant</i>, he looked like a philosopher; he looked
      intellectual, refined, ascetic even; he looked as if he had ideas,
      convictions; he looked grave and wise and sad. Holding the bank at
      baccarat, in this vulgar company at the Grand Cercle of the Casino,
      dealing the cards with his withered hands, studying them with his deep
      meditative eyes, he looked improbable, inadmissible, he looked supremely
      out of place.
    </p>
    <p>
      I glanced at him, and wondered. And then, suddenly, my heart gave a jump,
      my throat began to tingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had recognised him. It was rather more than ten years since I had seen
      him last; and in ten years he had changed, he had decayed, terribly. But I
      was quite sure, quite sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Ambrose&mdash;it&rsquo;s Augustus Ambrose! It&rsquo;s the
      Friend of Man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Augustus Ambrose? I daresay the name conveys nothing to you? And yet,
      forty, thirty, twenty years ago, Augustus Ambrose was not without his
      measure of celebrity in the world. If hardly any one had read his
      published writings, if few had any but the dimmest notion of what his
      theories and aims were, almost everybody had at least heard of him, almost
      everybody knew at least that there was such a man, and that the man had
      theories and aims&mdash;of some queer radical sort. One knew, in vague
      fashion, that he had disciples, that there were people here and there who
      called themselves &ldquo;Ambrosites.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I say twenty years ago. But twenty years ago he was already pretty well
      forgotten. I imagine the moment of his utmost notoriety would have fallen
      somewhere in the fifties or the sixties, somewhere between &rsquo;55 and &rsquo;68.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if my sudden recognition of him in the Casino made my heart give a
      jump, there was sufficient cause. During the greater part of my childhood,
      Augustus Ambrose lived with us, was virtually a member of our family. Then
      I saw a good deal of him again, when I was eighteen, nineteen; and still
      again, when I was four- or five-and-twenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lived with us, indeed, from the time when I was scarcely more than a
      baby till I was ten or eleven; so that in my very farthest memories he is
      a personage&mdash;looking backwards, I see him in the earliest, palest
      dawn: a tall man, dressed in black, with long hair and a long beard, who
      was always in our house, and who used to be frightfully severe; who would
      turn upon me with a most terrifying frown if I misconducted myself in his
      presence, who would loom up unexpectedly from behind closed doors, and
      utter a soul-piercing <i>hist-hist</i>, if I was making a noise: a sort of
      domesticated Croquemitaine, whom we had always with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always? Not quite always, though; for, when I stop to think, I remember
      there would be breathing spells: periods during which he would disappear&mdash;during
      which you could move about the room, and ask questions, and even (at a
      pinch) upset things, without being frowned at; during which you could
      shout lustily at your play, unoppressed by the fear of a black figure
      suddenly opening the door and freezing you with a <i>hist-hist</i>; during
      which, in fine, you could forget the humiliating circumstance that
      children are called into existence to be seen and not heard, with its
      irksome moral that they should never speak unless they are spoken to.
      Then, one morning, I would wake up, and find that he was in the house
      again. He had returned during the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was his habit, to return at night. But on one occasion, at least, he
      returned in the daytime. I remember driving with my father and mother, in
      our big open carriage, to the railway station, and then driving back home
      with Mr. Ambrose added to our party. Why I&mdash;a child of six or seven,
      between whom and our guest surely no love was lost&mdash;why I was taken
      upon this excursion, I can&rsquo;t at all conjecture; I suppose my people had
      their reasons. Anyhow, I recollect the drive home with particular
      distinctness. Two things impressed me. First, Mr. Ambrose, who always
      dressed in black, wore a <i>brown</i> overcoat; I remember gazing at it
      with bemused eyes, and reflecting that it was exactly the colour of gravy.
      And secondly, I gathered from his conversation that he had been in prison!
      Yes. I gathered that he had been in Rome (we were living in Florence), and
      that one day he had been taken up by the policemen, and put in prison!
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, I could say nothing; but what I felt, what I thought! Mercy
      upon us, that we should know a man, that a man should live with us, who
      had been taken up and put in prison! I fancied him dragged through the
      streets by two gendarmes, struggling with them, and followed by a crowd of
      dirty people. I felt that our family was disgraced, we who had been the
      pink of respectability; my cheeks burned, and I hung my head. I could say
      nothing; but oh, the grief, the shame, I nursed in secret! Mr. Ambrose,
      who lived with us, whose standards of conduct (for children, at any rate)
      were so painfully exalted, Mr. Ambrose had done something terrible, and
      had been found out, and put in prison for it! Mr. Ambrose, who always
      dressed in black, had suddenly tossed his bonnet over the mills, and
      displayed himself cynically in an overcoat of rakish, dare-devil brown&mdash;the
      colour of gravy! Somehow, the notion pursued me, there must be a
      connection between his overcoat and his crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enormity of the affair preyed upon my spirit, day after day, night
      after night, until, in the end, I could endure it silently no longer; and
      I spoke to my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Ambrose a burglar?&rdquo; I enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember my mother&rsquo;s perplexity, and then, when I had alleged the
      reasons for my question, her exceeding mirth. I remember her calling my
      father; and my father, also, laughed prodigiously, and he went to the
      door, and cried, &ldquo;Ambrose! Ambrose!&rdquo; And when Mr. Ambrose came, and the
      incident was related to him, even he laughed a little, even his stern face
      relaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, by-and-by, they had all stopped laughing, and Mr. Ambrose had gone
      back to his own room, my father and mother, between them, explained the
      matter to me. &ldquo;Mr. Ambrose, I must understand, (they said), was one of the
      greatest, and wisest, and best men in the world. He spent his whole life
      &ldquo;doing good.&rdquo; When he was at home, with us, he was working hard, all day
      long and late into the night, writing books H to &ldquo;do good&rdquo;&mdash;that was
      why he so often had a headache and couldn&rsquo;t bear any noise in the house.
      And when he went away, when he was absent, it was to &ldquo;do good&rdquo; somewhere
      else. I had seen the poor people in the streets? I knew that there were
      thousands and thousands of people in the world, grown-up people, and
      children like myself, who had to wear ragged clothing, and live in
      dreadful houses, and eat bad food, or go hungry perhaps, all because they
      were so poor? Well, Mr. Ambrose spent his whole life doing good to those
      poor people, working hard for them, so that some day they might be rich,
      and clean, and happy, like us. But in Rome there was a very wicked, very
      cruel man, a cardinal: Cardinal Antonelli was his name. And Cardinal
      Antonelli hated people who did good, and was always trying to kidnap them
      and put them in prison. And that was what had happened to Mr. Ambrose. He
      had been doing good to the poor people in Rome, and Cardinal Antonelli had
      got wind of it, and had sent his awful <i>sbirri</i> to seize him and put
      him in prison. But the Pope was a very good man, too; very just, and kind,
      and merciful; as good as it was possible for any man to be. Only,
      generally, he was so busy with the great spiritual cares of his office,
      that he couldn&rsquo;t pay much attention to the practical government of his
      City. He left that to Cardinal Antonelli, never suspecting how wicked he
      was, for the Cardinal constantly deceived him. But when the Pope heard
      that the great and good Mr. Ambrose had been put in prison, his Holiness
      was shocked and horrified, and very angry; and he sent for the Cardinal,
      and gave him a sound piece of his mind, and ordered him to let Mr. Ambrose
      out directly. And so Mr. Ambrose had been let out, and had come back to
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a relief, no doubt, to learn that our guest was not a burglar, but
      I am afraid the knowledge of his excessive goodness left me somewhat cold.
      Or, rather, if it influenced my feeling for him in any way, I fancy it
      only magnified my awe. He was one of the greatest, and wisest, and best
      men in the world, and he spent his entire time doing good to the poor. <i>Bene</i>;
      that was very nice for the poor. But for me? It did not make him a bit
      less severe, or cross, or testy; it did not make him a bit less an
      uncomfortable person to have in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, the character, in a story such as I had heard, most likely to
      affect a child&rsquo;s imagination, would pretty certainly have been, not the
      hero, but the villain. Mr. Ambrose and his virtues moved one to scant
      enthusiasm; but Cardinal Antonelli! In describing him as wicked, and
      cruel, and deceitful, my people were simply using the language, expressing
      the sentiment, of the country and the epoch: of Italy before 1870. In
      those days, if you were a Liberal, if you sympathised with the Italian
      party, as opposed to the Papal, and especially if you were a Catholic
      withal, and so could think no evil of the Pope himself&mdash;then Heaven
      help the reputation of Cardinal Antonelli! For my part, I saw a big man in
      a cassock, with a dark, wolfish face, and a bunch of great iron keys at
      his girdle, who prowled continually about the streets of Rome, attended by
      a gang of ruffian shim, seeking whom he could kidnap and put in prison. So
      that when, not very long after this, we went to Rome for a visit, my heart
      misgave me; it seemed as if we were marching headlong into the ogre&rsquo;s den,
      wantonly courting peril. And during the month or two of our sojourn there,
      I believe I was never quite easy in my mind. At any moment we might all be
      captured, loaded with chains, and cast into prison: horrible stone
      dungeons, dark and wet, infested by rats and spiders, where we should have
      to sleep on straw, where they would give us nothing but bread and water to
      eat and drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlatan. Impostor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t know what the words meant, but they stuck in my memory, and I
      felt that they were somehow appropriate. It was during that same visit to
      Rome that I had heard them. My Aunt Elizabeth, with whom we were staying,
      had applied them, in her vigorous way, to Mr. Ambrose (whom we had left
      behind us, in Florence). &ldquo;Poh! An empty windbag, a canting egotist, a
      twopenny-halfpenny charlatan, a cheap impostor,&rdquo; she had exclaimed, in the
      course of a discussion with my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlatan, impostor: yes, that was it. A man who never did anything but
      make himself disagreeable&mdash;who never petted you, or played with you,
      or told you stories, or gave you things&mdash;who never, in fact, took any
      notice of you at all, except to frown, and say <i>hist-hist</i>, when you
      were enjoying yourself&mdash;well, he might be one of the greatest, and
      best, and wisest men in the world, but, anyhow, he was a charlatan and an
      impostor. I had Aunt Elizabeth&rsquo;s authority for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, after our return to Florence, my second-cousin Isabel (she was
      thirteen, and I was in love with her)&mdash;my second-cousin Isabel was
      playing the piano, alone with me, in the schoolroom, when Mr. Ambrose
      opened the door, and said, in his testiest manner: &ldquo;Stop that noise&mdash;stop
      that noise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a horrid pig,&rdquo; cried Isabel, as soon as his back was turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; he isn&rsquo;t a pig,&rdquo; I protested. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s one of the greatest, and
      wisest, and best men in the world, so of course he can&rsquo;t be a horrid pig.
      But I&rsquo;ll tell you what he <i>is</i>. He&rsquo;s a charlatan and an impostor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? How do you know?&rdquo; Isabel wondered. &ldquo;I heard Aunt Elizabeth tell
      my father so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, then it must be true,&rdquo; Isabel assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lived with us till I was ten or eleven, at first in Florence, and
      afterwards in Paris. All day long he would sit in his room and write, (on
      the most beautiful, smooth, creamy paper&mdash;what wouldn&rsquo;t I have given
      to have acquired some of it for my own literary purposes!) and in the
      evening he would receive visitors: oh, such funny people, so unlike the
      people who came to see my mother and father. The men, for example, almost
      all of them, as Mr. Ambrose himself did, wore their hair long, so that it
      fell about their collars; whilst almost all the women had their hair cut
      short. And then, they dressed so funnily: the women in the plainest
      garments&mdash;skirts and jackets, without a touch of ornament; the men in
      sombreros and Spanish cloaks, instead of ordinary hats and coats. They
      would come night after night, and pass rapidly through the outer regions
      of our establishment, and disappear in Mr. Ambrose&rsquo;s private room. And
      thence I could hear their voices, murmuring, murmuring, after I had gone
      to bed. At the same time, very likely, in another part of the house, my
      mother would be entertaining another company, such a different company&mdash;beautiful
      ladies, in bright-hued silks, with shining jewels, and diamond-dust in
      their hair (yes, in that ancient period, ladies of fashion, on the
      Continent at least, used to powder their hair with a glittering substance
      known as &ldquo;diamond-dust&rdquo;) and officers in gold-embroidered uniforms, and
      men in dress-suits. And there would be music, and dancing, or theatricals,
      or a masquerade, and always a lovely supper&mdash;to some of whose
      unconsumed delicacies I would fall heir next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only four of Mr. Ambrose&rsquo;s visitors at all detach themselves, as
      individuals, from the cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      One was Mr. Oddo Yodo. Mr. Oddo Yodo was a small, grey-bearded,
      dark-skinned Hungarian gentleman, with another name, something like Polak
      or Bolak. But I called him Mr. Oddo Yodo, because whenever we met, on his
      way to or from the chamber of Mr. Ambrose, he would bow to me, and smile
      pleasantly, and say: &ldquo;Oddo Yodo, Oddo Yodo.&rdquo; I discovered, in the end,
      that he was paying me the compliment of saluting me in my native tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another was an Irishman, named Slevin. I remember him, a burly creature,
      with a huge red beard, because one day he arrived at our house in a state
      of appalling drunkenness. I remember the incredulous dismay with which I
      saw a man in that condition enter our very house. I remember our old
      servant, Alexandre, supporting him to Mr. Ambrose&rsquo;s door, nodding his head
      and making a face the while, to signify his opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still another was a pale young Italian priest, with a tonsure, round and
      big as a five-shilling piece, shorn in the midst of a dense growth of
      blue-black hair, upon which I always vaguely longed to put my finger, to
      see how it would feel. I forget his name, but I shall never forget the
      man, for he had an extraordinary talent; he could write <i>upside-down</i>.
      He would take a sheet of paper, and, beginning with the last letter, write
      my name for me upside-down, terminating it at the first initial with a
      splendid flourish. You will not wonder that I remember him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitor that I remember best, though, was a woman named Arseneff. She
      had short sandy hair, and she dressed in the ugliest black frocks, and she
      wore steel-rimmed spectacles; but she was a dear soul, notwithstanding.
      One afternoon she was shown into the room where I chanced to be studying
      my arithmetic lesson, to wait for Mr. Ambrose. And first, she sat down
      beside me, in the kindest fashion, and helped me out with my sums; and
      then (it is conceivable that I may have encouraged her by some
      cross-questioning) she told me the saddest, saddest story about herself.
      She told me that her husband had been the editor of a newspaper in Russia,
      and that he had published an article in his paper, saying that there ought
      to be schools where the poor people, who had to work all day, could go in
      the evening, and learn to read and write. And just for that, for nothing
      more than that, her husband and her two sons, who were his
      assistant-editors, had been arrested, and chained up with murderers and
      thieves and all the worst sorts of criminals, and forced to march, <i>on
      foot</i>, across thousands of miles of snow-covered country, to Siberia,
      where they had to work as convicts in the mines. And her husband, she
      said, had died of it; but her two sons were still there, working as
      convicts in the mines. She showed me their photographs, and she showed me
      a button, rather a pretty button of coloured glass, with gilt specks in
      it, that she had cut from the coat of one of them, when he had been
      arrested and taken from her. Poor Arséneff; my heart went out to her, and
      we became fast friends. She was never tired of talking, nor I of hearing,
      of her sons; and she gave me a good deal of practical assistance in my
      arithmetical researches, so that, at the Lycée where I was then an <i>externe</i>,
      I passed for an authority on Long Division.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ambrose&rsquo;s visitors came night after night, and shut themselves up with
      him in his room, and stayed there, talking, talking, till long past
      bed-time; but I never knew what it was all about. Indeed, I can&rsquo;t remember
      that I ever felt any curiosity to know. It was simply a fact, a quite
      uninteresting fact, which one witnessed, and accepted, and thought no more
      of. Mr. Ambrose was an Olympian. Kenneth Grahame has reminded us with what
      superior unconcern, at the Golden Age, one regards the habits and doings
      and affairs of the Olympians.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, quite suddenly, Mr. Ambrose left us. He packed up his things and
      his books, and went away; and I understood, somehow, that he would not be
      coming back. I did not ask where he was going, nor why he was going. His
      departure, like his presence, was a fact which I accepted without
      curiosity. Not without satisfaction, though; it was distinctly nice to
      feel that the house was rid of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then seven or eight years passed, the longest seven or eight years, I
      suppose, that one is likely ever to encounter, the seven or eight years in
      the course of which one grows from a child of ten or eleven to a youth
      approaching twenty. And during those years I had plenty of other things to
      think of than Mr. Ambrose. It was time more than enough for him to become
      a mere dim outline on the remote horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      My childish conception of the man, as you perceive, was sufficiently
      rudimental. He represented to me the incarnation of a single principle:
      severity; as I, no doubt, represented to him the incarnation of vexatious
      noise. For the rest, we overlooked each other. I had been told that he was
      one of the greatest and wisest and best men in the world: you have seen
      how little that mattered to me. It would probably have mattered quite as
      little if the information had been more specific, if I had been told
      everything there was to tell about him, all that I have learned since. How
      could it have mattered to a child to know that the testy old man who sat
      in his room all day and wrote, and every evening received a stream of
      shabby visitors, was the prophet of a new social faith, the founder of a
      new sect, the author of a new system for the regeneration of mankind, of a
      new system of human government, a new system of ethics, a new system of
      economics? What could such a word as &ldquo;anthropocracy&rdquo; have conveyed to me?
      Or such a word as &ldquo;philarchy&rdquo;? Or such a phrase as &ldquo;Unification <i>versus</i>
      Civilisation"?
    </p>
    <p>
      My childish conception of the man was extremely rudimental. But I saw a
      good deal of him again when I was eighteen, nineteen; and at eighteen,
      nineteen, one begins, more or less, to observe and appreciate, to receive
      impressions and to form conclusions. Anyhow, the impressions I received of
      Mr. Ambrose, the conclusions I formed respecting him, when I was eighteen
      or nineteen, are still very fresh in my mind; and I can&rsquo;t help believing
      that on the whole they were tolerably just. I think they were just,
      because they seem to explain him; they seem to explain him in big and in
      little. They explain his career, his failure, his table manners, his
      testiness, his disregard of other people&rsquo;s rights and feelings, his
      apparent selfishness; they explain the queerest of the many queer things
      he did. They explain his taking the bank the other night at baccarat, for
      instance; and they explain what happened afterwards, before the night was
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, when I was eighteen or nineteen, coming home from the Latin
      Quarter, where I was a student, to dine with my people, in the Rue
      Oudinot, I found Mr. Ambrose in the drawing-room. Or, if you will, I found
      a stranger in the drawing-room, but a stranger whom it took me only a
      minute or two to recognise. My father, at my entrance, had smiled, with a
      little air of mystery, and said to me, &ldquo;Here is an old friend of yours.
      Can you tell who it is?&rdquo; And the stranger, also&mdash;somewhat faintly&mdash;smiling,
      had risen, and offered me his hand. I looked at him&mdash;looked at him&mdash;and,
      in a minute,% I exclaimed, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mr. Ambrose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I can see him now almost as clearly as I saw him then, when he stood
      before me, faintly smiling: tall and thin, stooping a little, dressed in
      black, with a long broad beard, long hair, and a pale, worn, aquiline
      face. It is the face especially that comes back to me, pale and worn and
      finely aquiline, the face, the high white brow, the deep eyes set wide
      apart, the faint, faded smile: a striking face&mdash;an intellectual face&mdash;a
      handsome face, despite many wrinkles&mdash;an indescribably sad face, even
      a tragic face&mdash;and yet, for some reason, a face that was not
      altogether sympathetic. Something, something in it, had the effect rather
      of chilling you, of leaving you where you were, than of warming and
      attracting you; something hard to fix, perhaps impossible to name. A
      certain suggestion of remoteness, of aloofness? A suggestion of
      abstraction from his surroundings and his company, of inattention, of
      indifference to them? Of absorption in matters alien to them, outside
      their sphere? I did not know. But there was surely something in his face
      not perfectly sympathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had exclaimed, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mr. Ambrose!&rdquo; To that he had responded, &ldquo;Ah, you
      have a good memory.&rdquo; And then we shook hands, and he sat down again. His
      hand was thin and delicate, and slightly cold. His voice was a trifle dry,
      ungenial. Then he asked me the inevitable half-dozen questions about
      myself&mdash;how old I was, what I was studying, and so forth&mdash;but
      though he asked them with an evident intention of being friendly, one felt
      that he was all the while half thinking of something else, and that he
      never really took in one&rsquo;s answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And gradually he seemed to become unconscious of my presence, resuming the
      conversation with my father, which, I suppose, had been interrupted by my
      arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world has forgotten me. My followers have dropped away. You yourself&mdash;where
      is your ancient ardour? The cause I have lived for stands still. My
      propaganda is arrested. I am poor, I am obscure, I am friendless, and I am
      sixty-five years old. But the great ideals, the great truths, I have
      taught, remain. They are like gold which I have mined. There the gold
      lies, between the covers of my books, as in so many caskets. Some day, in
      its necessities, the world will find it. What is excellent cannot perish.
      It may lie hid, but it cannot perish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That is one of the things I remember his saying to my father, on that
      first evening of our renewed acquaintance. And, at table, I noticed, he
      ate and drank in a joyless, absent-minded manner, and made unusual uses of
      his knife and fork, and very unusual noises. And, by-and-by, in the midst
      of a silence, my mother spoke to a servant, whereupon, suddenly, he
      glanced up, with vague eyes, and the frown of one troubled in the depths
      of a brown study, and I could have sworn it was on the tip of his tongue
      to say <i>hist-hist!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      He stayed with us for several months&mdash;from the beginning of November
      till February or March, I think&mdash;and during that period I saw him
      very nearly every day, and heard him accomplish a tremendous deal of talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried, besides, to read some of his books, an effort, however, from
      which I retired, baffled and bewildered: they were a thousand miles above
      the apprehension of a nineteen-year-old <i>potache</i>; and I did actually
      read to its end a book about him: <i>Augustus Ambrose, the Friend of Man:
      an Account of his Life, and an Analysis of his Teachings. By one of his
      Followers. Turin: privately printed</i>, 1858. Of the identity of that
      &ldquo;Follower,&rdquo; by-the-bye, I got an inkling, from a rather conscious, half
      sheepish smile, which I detected in the face of my own father, when he saw
      the volume in my hands. I read his <i>Life</i> to its end; and I tried to
      read <i>The Foundations of Mono-pantology, and Anthropocracy: a Remedy for
      the Diseases of the Body Politic, and Philarchy: a Vision </i>; and I
      listened while he accomplished a tremendous deal of talk. His talk was
      always (for my taste) too impersonal; it was always of ideas, of theories,
      never of concrete things, never of individual men and women. Indeed, the
      mention of an individual would often only serve him as an excuse for a new
      flight into the abstract. For example, I had learned, from the <i>Life</i>,
      that he had been an associate of Mazzini&rsquo;s and Garibaldi&rsquo;s in &rsquo;48, and
      that it was no less a person than Victor Emmanuel himself, who had named
      him&mdash;in an official proclamation, too&mdash;&ldquo;the Friend of Man.&rdquo; So,
      one day, I asked him to tell me something about Victor Emmanuel, and
      Mazzini, and Garibaldi. &ldquo;You knew them. I should be so glad to hear about
      them from one who knew them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Victor Emmanuel, Garibaldi, Mazzini, Cavour&mdash;I knew them all; I knew
      them well. I worked with them, fought under them, wrote for them, spoke
      for them, throughout the long struggle for the unification of Italy. I did
      so because unification is my supreme ideal, the grandest ideal the human
      mind has ever formed. I worked for the unification of Italy, because I was
      and am working for the unification of mankind, and the unification of
      Italy was a step towards, and an illustration of, that sublime object. Let
      others prate of civilisation; civilisation means nothing more than the
      invention and multiplication of material conveniences&mdash;nothing more
      than that. But unification&mdash;the unification of mankind&mdash;that is
      the crusade which I have preached, the cause for which I have lived. To
      unify the scattered nations of this earth into one single nation, one
      single solidarity, under one government, speaking one language, professing
      and obeying one religion, pursuing one aim. The religion&mdash;Christianity,
      with a purified Papacy. The government&mdash;anthropocratic philarchy, the
      reign of men by the law of Love. The language&mdash;Albigo. Albigo, which
      means, at the same time, both human and universal&mdash;from Albi,
      pertaining to man, and God, pertaining to the whole, the all. Albigo: a
      language which I have discovered, as the result of years of research, to
      exist already, and everywhere, as the base, the common principle, of all
      known languages, and which I have extracted, in its original simplicity,
      from the overgrowths which time and separateness have allowed to
      accumulate upon it. Albigo: the tongue which all men speak unconsciously:
      the universal human tongue. And, finally, the aim&mdash;the common, single
      aim&mdash;the highest possible spiritual development of man, the highest
      possible culture of the human soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That is what I received in response to my request for a few personal
      reminiscences of Victor Emmanuel, Garibaldi, and Mazzini.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will infer that Mr. Ambrose lacked humour. But his most conspicuous
      trait, his preponderant trait&mdash;the trait which, I think, does more
      than any other to explain him, him and his fortunes and his actions&mdash;was
      the trait I had vaguely noticed in our first five minutes&rsquo; intercourse,
      after my re-introduction to him; the trait which, I have conjectured,
      perhaps gave its unsympathetic quality to his face: abstraction from his
      surroundings and his company, inattention, indifference, to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that first evening, you may remember, he had asked me certain
      questions; but I had felt that he was thinking of something else. I had
      answered them, but I had felt that he never heard my answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      That little negative incident, I believe, gives the key to his character,
      to his fortunes, to his actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Friend of Man was totally deaf and blind and insensible to <i>men</i>.
      Man, as a metaphysical concept, was the major premiss of his philosophy;
      men, as individuals, he was totally unable to realise. He could not see
      you, he could not hear you, he could get no &ldquo;realising sense&rdquo; of you. You
      spoke, but your voice was an unintelligible murmur in his ears; it was
      like the sound of the wind&mdash;it might annoy him, disturb him (in which
      case he would seek to silence it with a <i>hist-hist</i>), it could not
      signify to him. You stood up, in front of him; but you were invisible to
      him; he saw beyond you. And even when he spoke, he did not speak to you,
      he spoke to the walls and ceiling&mdash;he thought aloud. He took no
      account of his auditor&rsquo;s capacities, of the subject that would interest
      him, of the language he would understand. You asked him to tell you about
      Mazzini, and he discoursed of Albigo and the Unification of Mankind. And
      then, when he ceased to speak, directly he fell silent and somebody else
      took the word, the gates of his mind were shut; he withdrew behind them,
      returned to his private meditations, and so remained, detached, solitary,
      preoccupied, till the time came when he was moved to speak again. He was
      the Friend of Man, but men did not exist for him. He was like a
      mathematician busied with a calculation, eager for the sum-total, but
      heedless of the separate integers. My father&mdash;my mother&mdash;I&mdash;whosoever
      approached him&mdash;was a phantasm: a convenient phantasm, possibly, with
      a house where he might be lodged and fed, with a purse whence might be
      supplied the funds requisite for the publication of his works; or possibly
      a troublesome phantasm, that worried him by shouting at its play: but a
      phantasm, none the less.
    </p>
    <p>
      Years ago, my downright Aunt Elizabeth had disposed of him with two words:
      a charlatan, an impostor. My Aunt Elizabeth was utterly mistaken. Mr.
      Ambrose&rsquo;s sincerity was absolute. The one thing he professed belief in, he
      believed in with an intensity that rendered him unconscious of all things
      else; his one conviction was so predominant as to exclude all other
      convictions. What was the one thing he believed in, the one thing he was
      convinced of? It would be easy to reply, himself; to declare that, at
      least, when she had called him an egotist, my Aunt Elizabeth had been
      right. It would be easy, but I am sure it would be untrue. The thing he
      believed in, the thing he was convinced of, the only thing in this whole
      universe which he saw, was his vision. That, I am persuaded, is the
      explanation of the man. It explains him in big and in little. It explains
      his career, his fortunes, his failure, his table-manners, his testiness,
      and the queerest of his actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw nothing in this universe but his vision; he did not see the earth
      beneath him, nor the people round him. Is that not enough to explain
      everything, almost to justify anything? Doesn&rsquo;t it explain his failure,
      for example? The fact that the world ignored him, that his followers
      dropped away from him, that nobody read his books? For, since he was never
      convinced of the world, how could he convince the world? Since he had no
      &ldquo;realising sense&rdquo; of men, how could he hold men? Since, in writing his
      books, he took no account of human nature, no account of human taste,
      endurance&mdash;since he wrote his books, as he spoke his speeches, not to
      you or me, not to flesh and blood, but to the walls and ceiling, to space,
      to the unpeopled air&mdash;how was it possible that he should have human
      readers? It explains his failure, the failure of a long life of
      unremitting labour. He was learned, he was in earnest, he was
      indefatigable; and the net product of his learning, his earnestness, his
      industry, was nil, because there can be no reciprocity established between
      something and nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It explains his failure; and it explains&mdash;it almost excuses&mdash;in
      a sense it even almost justifies&mdash;the queerest of his actions. Other
      people did not exist for him; therefore other people had no feelings to be
      considered, no rights, no possessions, to be respected. They did not
      exist, therefore they were in no way to be reckoned with. Their
      observation was not to be avoided, their power was not to be feared. They
      could not <i>do</i> anything; they could not see what <i>he</i> did.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queerest of his actions? You will suppose that I must have some very
      queer action still to record. Well, there was his action the other night
      at the Casino, for one thing; I haven&rsquo;t yet done with that. But the
      queerest of all his actions, I think, was his treatment of Israela, his
      step-daughter Israela....
    </p>
    <p>
      During the visit Mr. Ambrose paid us in Paris, when I was nineteen, he,
      whose early disciples had dropped away, made a new disciple: a Madame
      Fontanas, a Mexican woman&mdash;of Jewish extraction, I imagine&mdash;a
      widow, with a good deal of money. Israela, her daughter, was a fragile,
      pale-faced, dark-haired, great-eyed little girl, of twelve or thirteen.
      Madame Fontanas sat at Mr. Ambrose&rsquo;s feet, and listened, and believed.
      Perhaps she conceived an affection for him; perhaps she only thought that
      here was a great philosopher, a great philanthropist, and that he ought to
      have some one to take permanent care of him, and reduce the material
      friction of his path to a minimum. Anyhow, when the spring came, she
      married him. I have no definite information on the subject, but I am sure
      in my own mind that it was she who took the initiative&mdash;that she
      offered, and he vaguely accepted, her hand. Anyhow, in the spring she
      married him, and carried him off to her Mexican estates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five or six years later (by the sheerest hazard) I found him living in
      London with Israela; in the dreariest of dreary lodgings, in a dreary
      street, in Pimlico. I met him one afternoon, by the sheerest hazard, in
      Piccadilly, and accompanied him home. (It was characteristic of him,
      by-the-bye, that, though we met face to face, and I stopped and exclaimed
      and held out my hand, he gazed at me with blank eyes, and I was obliged to
      repeat my name twice before he could recall me.) He was living in London,
      for the present, he told me, in order to see a work through the press. &ldquo;A
      great work, the crown, the summary of all my work. <i>The Final Extensions
      of Monopantology.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is in twelve volumes, with plates, coloured plates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mrs. Ambrose is well?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my wife&mdash;my wife is dead. She died two or three years ago,&rdquo; he
      answered, with the air of one dismissing an irrelevance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Israela?&rdquo; I pursued, by-and-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Israela?&rdquo; His brows knitted themselves perplexedly, then, in an instant,
      cleared. &ldquo;Oh, Israela. Ah, yes. Israela is living with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And upon my suggesting that I should like to call upon her, he replied
      that he was on his way home now, and, if I cared to do so, I might come
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were living in the dreariest of dreary lodgings, in the dreariest of
      streets. But Israela welcomed me with a warmth I had not anticipated. &ldquo;Oh,
      I am so glad to see you, so glad, so glad,&rdquo; she cried, and her big, dark
      eyes filled with tears, and she clung to my hand. I was surprised by her
      emotion, because, after all, I was scarcely other than a stranger to her;
      a man she hadn&rsquo;t seen since she was a little girl, and even then had seen
      only once or twice. I understood it afterwards, however: when one day she
      confided to me that&mdash;excepting Mr. Ambrose himself, and servants and
      tradesmen&mdash;I was the first human being she had exchanged a word with
      since they had come to London! &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know anybody&mdash;not a soul,
      not a soul. He doesn&rsquo;t want to know people&mdash;he is so absorbed in his
      work. I could not make acquaintances alone. And we had been here four
      months, before he met you and brought you home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Israela was tall, and very slight; very delicate-looking, with a face
      intensely pale, all the paler for the soft dark hair that curled above it,
      and the great dark eyes that looked out of it. Considering that she must
      have inherited a decent fortune from her mother, I wondered, rather, to
      see her so plainly dressed: she wore the plainest straight black frocks.
      And, of course, I wondered also to find them living in such dismal
      lodgings. However, it was not for me to ask questions; and if presently
      the mystery cleared itself up, it was by a sort of accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      I called at the house in Pimlico as often as I could; and I took Israela
      out a good deal, to lunch or dine at restaurants; and when the weather
      smiled, we would make little jaunts into the country, to Hampton Court, or
      Virginia Water, or where not. And one day she came to tea with me, at my
      chambers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve got a piano,&rdquo; was her first observation, and she flew to the
      instrument, and seated herself, and began to play. She played without
      pause for nearly an hour, I think: Chopin, Chopin, Chopin. And when she
      rose, I said, &ldquo;Would you mind telling me why you&mdash;a brilliant pianist
      like you&mdash;why you haven&rsquo;t a piano in your own rooms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford one,&rdquo; she answered simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean&mdash;you can&rsquo;t afford one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says we can&rsquo;t afford one. Don&rsquo;t you know&mdash;we are very poor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be very poor,&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Your mother was rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my mother was rich. I don&rsquo;t know what has become of her money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t she leave a will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, she left a will. She left a will making my step-father my
      guardian, my trustee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what has he done with your money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I only know that we are very poor&mdash;that we can&rsquo;t
      afford any luxuries&mdash;that we can just barely contrive to live, in the
      quietest manner. He hardly ever gives me any money for myself. A few
      shillings, very rarely, when I ask him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;I see it all, I see it perfectly. You&rsquo;ve got
      plenty of money, you&rsquo;ve got your mother&rsquo;s fortune. But he&rsquo;s spending it
      for his own purposes. He&rsquo;s paying for the printing of his gigantic book
      with it. Twelve volumes, and plates, coloured plates! It&rsquo;s exactly like
      him. The only thing he&rsquo;s conscious of is the importance of publishing his
      book. He needs money. He takes it where he finds it. He&rsquo;s spending your
      money for the printing of his book; and that&rsquo;s why you have to live in
      dreary lodgings in the dreariest part of London, and do without a piano.
      <i>He</i> doesn&rsquo;t care how he lives&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t know&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      unconscious of everything but his book. My dear child, you must stop him,
      you mustn&rsquo;t let him go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Israela was incredulous at first, but I argued and insisted, till, in the
      end, she said, &ldquo;Perhaps you are right. But even so, what can I do? How can
      I stop him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s a question for a solicitor. We must see a solicitor. A
      solicitor will know how to stop him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at this proposal, Israela shook her head. &ldquo;Oh, no, I will have no
      solicitor. Even supposing your idea is true, I can&rsquo;t set a lawyer upon my
      mother&rsquo;s husband. After all, what does it matter? Perhaps he is right.
      Perhaps the publication of his book <i>is</i> very important. I&rsquo;m sure my
      mother would have thought so. It was her money. Perhaps he is right to
      spend it for the publication of his book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Israela positively declined to consult a solicitor; and so they continued
      to live narrowly in Pimlico, and he proceeded with the issue of <i>The
      Final Extensions of Monopantology</i>, in twelve volumes, with coloured
      plates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the brown London autumn had turned into a black London winter;
      and Israela, delicate-looking at its outset, grew more and more
      delicate-looking every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, what does it matter? The money will be his, and he can do as
      he wishes with it honestly as soon as I am dead,&rdquo; she said to me, one
      evening, with a smile I did not like.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth do you mean?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to die,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re mad, you&rsquo;re morbid,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t say such things. You&rsquo;re
      not <i>ill?</i> What on earth do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to die. I know it. I feel it. I am not ill? I don&rsquo;t know. I
      think I am ill. I feel as if I were going to be ill. I am going to die&mdash;I
      know I am going to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did what I could to dissipate such black presentiments. I refused to
      talk of them. I did what I could to lend a little gaiety to her life. But
      Israela grew whiter and more delicate-looking day by day. I was her only
      visitor. I had asked if I might not bring a friend or two to see her, but
      she had answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he would not like it. People coming and
      going would disturb him. He can&rsquo;t bear any noise,&rdquo; So I was her only
      visitor&mdash;till, by-and-by, another became necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wonder whether Mr. Ambrose ever really knew that Israela was lying in
      her bed at the point of death, and that the man who called twice every day
      to see her was a doctor? True, in an absent-minded fashion, he used to
      inquire how she was, he used even occasionally to enter the sick-room, and
      look at her, and lay his hand on her brow, as if to take her temperature;
      but I wonder whether he ever actually <i>realised</i> her condition? He
      was terribly preoccupied just then with Volume VIII, At all events, on a
      certain melancholy morning in April, he allowed me to conduct him to a
      carriage and to help him in; and together we drove to Kensal Green. He was
      silent during the drive&mdash;thinking hard, I fancied, about some matter
      very foreign to our errand.... And as soon as the parson there had rattled
      through his office and concluded it, Israela&rsquo;s step-father pulled out his
      watch, and said to me, &ldquo;Ah, I must hurry off, I must hurry off. I&rsquo;ve got a
      long day&rsquo;s work before me still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was something like ten years ago&mdash;the last time I had seen
      him.... Until now, to-night, on this sultry night of August, ten years
      afterwards, here he had suddenly reappeared to me, holding the bank at
      baccarat, at the Grand Cercle of the Casino: Augustus Ambrose, the Friend
      of Man, the dreamer, the visionary, holding the bank at baccarat, at the
      Grand Cercle of the Casino!
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at him, in simple astonishment at first, and then gradually I
      shaped a theory. &ldquo;He has probably come pretty nearly to the end of
      Israela&rsquo;s fortune; it would be like him to spend interest and principal as
      well. And now he finds himself in need of money. And he is just
      unpractical enough to fancy that he can supply his needs by play. Or&mdash;or
      is it possible he has a system? Perhaps he imagines he has a system.&rdquo; And
      then I thought how old he had grown, how terribly, terribly he had
      decayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at him. He was dealing. He dealt to the right, to the left, and
      to himself. But when he glanced at his own two cards, he made a little
      face. The next instant he had dropped them under the table, and helped
      himself to two fresh ones....
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing was done without the faintest effort at concealment, in a room
      where at least forty pairs of eyes were fixed upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, of course, an immediate uproar. In an instant every one was on
      his feet; Mr. Ambrose was surrounded. Men were shaking their fists in his
      face, screaming at him excitedly, calling him ugly names. He gazed at them
      placidly, vaguely. It was clear he did not grasp the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody must needs intervene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw what Monsieur did. I am sure it was with no ill intention. He made
      no effort at concealment. It was done in a fit of absence of mind. Look at
      him. He is a very old man. You can see he is bewildered. He does not even
      yet understand what has happened. He should never have come here, at his
      age. He should never have been allowed to take the bank. Let the croupier
      pay both sides. Then I will take Monsieur away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somehow I got him out of the Casino, and led him to his hotel, a small
      hotel in the least favoured quarter of the town, the name of which I had a
      good deal of difficulty in extracting from him. On the way thither
      scarcely a word passed between us. I forbore to tell him who I was; of
      course, he did not recognise me. But all the while a pertinacious little
      voice within me insisted: &ldquo;He did it deliberately. He deliberately tried
      to cheat. With his gaze concentrated on his vision, he could see nothing
      else; he could see no harm in trying to cheat at cards. He needed money&mdash;it
      didn&rsquo;t matter how he obtained it. The other players were phantasms&mdash;where&rsquo;s
      the harm in cheating phantasms? Only he forgot&mdash;or, rather, he never
      realised&mdash;that the phantasms had eyes, that they could see. That&rsquo;s
      why he made no effort at concealment.&rdquo;&mdash;Was the voice right or wrong?
    </p>
    <p>
      I parted with him at the door of his hotel; but the next day a feeling
      grew within me that I ought to call upon him, that I ought at least to
      call and take his news. They told me that he had left by an early train
      for Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I have been writing these last pages, a line of Browning&rsquo;s has kept
      thrumming through my head. &ldquo;This high man, with a great thing to pursue...
      This high man, with a great thing to pursue...&rdquo; How does it apply to Mr.
      Ambrose? I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;unless, indeed, a high man, with a great thing
      to pursue, is to be excused, is to be pitied, rather than blamed, if he
      loses his sense, his conscience, of other things, of small things. After
      all, wasn&rsquo;t it because he lost his conscience of small things, that he
      missed his great thing?

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> wonder what the
      secret of it is&mdash;why that little fragment of a musical phrase has
      always had this instant, irresistible power to move me. The tune of which
      it formed a part I have never heard; whether it was a merry tune or a sad
      tune, a pretty tune or a stupid one, I have no means of guessing. A
      sequence of six notes, like six words taken from the middle of a sentence,
      it stands quite by itself, detached, fortuitous. If I were to pick it out
      for you on the piano, you would scoff at it; you would tell me that it is
      altogether pointless and unsuggestive, that any six notes, struck at
      haphazard, would signify as much. And I certainly could not, with the
      least show of reason, maintain the contrary. I could only wonder the more
      why it has always had, for me, this very singular charm. As when I was a
      child, so now, after all these years, it is a sort of talisman in my
      hands, a thing to conjure with. I have but to breathe it never so softly
      to myself, and (if I choose) the actual world melts away, and I am
      journeying on wings in dreamland. Whether I choose or not, it always
      thrills my heart with responsive echoes, it always wakes a sad, sweet
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember quite clearly the day when I first heard it; quite clearly,
      though it was more&mdash;oh, more than five-and-twenty years ago, and the
      days that went before and came after it have entirely lost their outlines,
      and merged into a vague golden blur. That day, too, as I look backwards,
      glows in the distance with a golden light; and if I were to speak upon my
      impulse, I should vow it was a smiling day of June, clothed in sunshine
      and crowned with roses. But then, if I were to speak upon my impulse, I
      should vow that it was June at Saint-Graal the whole year round. When I
      stop to think, I remember that it was a rainy day, and that the ground was
      sprinkled with dead leaves. I remember standing at a window in my
      grandmother&rsquo;s room, and gazing out with rueful eyes. It rained doggedly,
      relentlessly&mdash;even, it seemed to me, defiantly, spitefully, as if it
      took a malicious pleasure in penning me up within doors. The mountains,
      the Pyrenees, a few miles to the south, were completely hidden by the veil
      of waters. The sodden leaves, brown patches on the lawn and in the
      pathways, struggled convulsively, like wounded birds, to fly from the
      gusts of wind, but fell back fluttering heavily. One could almost have
      touched the clouds, they hung so low, big ragged tufts of sad-coloured
      cotton-wool, blown rapidly through the air, just above the writhing
      tree-tops. Everywhere in the house there was a faint fragrance of burning
      wood: fires had been lighted to keep the dampness out.

      Indeed, if it had been a fair day, my adventure could scarcely have
      befallen. I should have been abroad, in the garden or the forest, playing
      with André, our farmer&rsquo;s son; angling, with a bit of red worsted as bait,
      for frogs in the pond; trying to catch lizards on the terrace; lying under
      a tree with <i>Don Quixote</i> or <i>Le Capitaine Fracasse</i>; visiting
      Manuela in her cottage; or perhaps, best of all, spending the afternoon
      with Hélène, at Granjolaye. It was because the rain interdicted these
      methods of amusement that I betook myself for solace to <i>Constantinople</i>.

    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t know why&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think any one knew why&mdash;that part of
      our house was called Constantinople; but it had been called so from time
      immemorial, and we all accepted it as a matter of course. It was the
      topmost story of the East Wing&mdash;three rooms: one little room, by way
      of ante-chamber, into which you entered from a corkscrew staircase; then
      another little room at your left; and then a big room, a long dim room,
      with only two windows, one at either end. And these rooms served as a sort
      of Hades for departed household gods. They were crowded, crowded to
      overflowing, with such wonderful old things! Old furniture&mdash;old
      straight-backed chairs, old card-tables, with green cloth tops, and brass
      claws for feet, old desks and cabinets, the dismembered relics of old
      four-post bedsteads; old clothes&mdash;old hats, boots, cloaks&mdash;green
      silk calashes, like bonnets meant for the ladies of Brobdingnag&mdash;and
      old hoop-petticoats, the skeletons of dead toilets; old books, newspapers,
      pictures; old lamps and candlesticks, clocks, fire-irons, vases; an old
      sedan-chair; old spurs, old swords, old guns and pistols; generations upon
      generations of superannuated utilities and vanities, slumbering in one
      another&rsquo;s shadows, under a common sheet of dust, and giving off a thin,
      penetrating, ancient smell.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it rained, Constantinople was my ever-present refuge. It was a land
      of penumbra and mystery, a realm of perpetual wonderment, a mine of
      inexhaustible surprises. I never visited it without finding something new,
      without getting a sensation. One day, when André was there with me, we
      both saw a ghost&mdash;yes, as plainly as at this moment I see the paper
      I&rsquo;m writing on; but I won&rsquo;t turn aside now to speak of that. And as for my
      finds, on two or three occasions, at least, they had more than a
      subjective metaphysical importance. The first was a chest filled with
      jewellery and trinkets, an iron chest, studded with nails, in size and
      shape like a small trunk, with a rounded lid. I dragged it out of a dark
      corner, from amidst a quantity of rubbish, and (it wasn&rsquo;t even locked!)
      fancy the eyes I made when I beheld its contents: half-a-dozen elaborately
      carved, high-back tortoise-shell combs, ranged in a morocco case; a
      beautiful old-fashioned watch, in the form of a miniature guitar; an
      enamelled snuff-box; and then no end of rings, brooches, buckles, seals,
      and watch-keys, set with precious stones&mdash;not very precious stones,
      perhaps&mdash;only garnets, amethysts, carnelians; but mercy, how they
      glittered! I ran off in great excitement to call my grandmother; and she
      called my uncle Edmond; and he, alas, applied the laws of seigniory to the
      transaction, and I saw my trover appropriated. My other important finds
      were appropriated also, but about them I did not care so much&mdash;they
      were only papers. One was a certificate, dated in the Year III, and
      attesting that my grandfather&rsquo;s father had taken the oath of allegiance to
      the Republic. As I was a fierce Legitimist, this document afforded me but
      moderate satisfaction. The other was a Map of the World, covering a sheet
      of cardboard nearly a yard square, executed in pen-and-ink, but with such
      a complexity of hair-lines, delicate shading, and ornate lettering, that,
      until you had examined it closely, you would have thought it a carefully
      finished steel-engraving. It was signed &ldquo;Herminie de Pontacq, 1818&rdquo;; that
      is to say, by my grandmother herself, who in 1818 had been twelve years
      old; dear me, only twelve years old! It was delightful and marvellous to
      think that my own grandmother, in 1818, had been so industrious, and
      painstaking, and accomplished a little girl. I assure you, I felt almost
      as proud as if I had done it myself.

      The small room at the left of the ante-chamber was consecrated to the <i>roba</i>
      of an uncle of my grandfather&rsquo;s, who had been a sugar-planter in the
      province of New Orleans, in the reign of Louis XVI. He had also been a
      colonel, and so the room was called the Colonel&rsquo;s room. Here were
      numberless mementos of the South: great palm-leaf fans, conch-shells, and
      branches of coral, broad-brimmed hats of straw, monstrous white umbrellas,
      and, in a corner, a collection of long slender wands, ending in thick
      plumes of red and yellow feathers. These, I was informed, the
      sugar-planter&rsquo;s slaves, standing behind his chair, would flourish about
      his head, to warn off the importunate winged insects that abound <i>là-bas</i>.
      He had died at Paris in 1793, and of nothing more romantic than a
      malignant fever, foolish person, when he might so easily have been
      guillotined! (It was a matter of permanent regret with me that <i>none</i>
      of our family had been guillotined.) But his widow had survived him for
      more than forty years, and her my grandmother remembered perfectly. A fat
      old Spanish Créole lady, fat and very lazy&mdash;oh, but very lazy indeed.
      At any rate, she used to demand the queerest services of the negress who
      was in constant attendance upon her. &ldquo;Nanette, Nanette, tourne tête à moi.
      Veux&rdquo;&mdash;summon your fortitude&mdash;&ldquo;veux cracher!&rdquo; Ah, well, we are
      told, they made less case of such details in those robust old times. How
      would she have fared, poor soul, had she fallen amongst us squeamish
      decadents?

      It was into the Colonel&rsquo;s room that I turned to-day. There was a cupboard
      in its wall that I had never thoroughly examined. The lower shelves,
      indeed, I knew by heart; they held, for the most part, empty medicine
      bottles. But the upper ones?

    <p>
      I shut my eyes for a moment, and the flavour of that far-away afternoon
      comes back fresher in my memory than yesterday&rsquo;s. I am perched on a chair,
      in the dim light of Constantinople, at Saint-Graal; my nostrils are full
      of a musty, ancient smell; I can hear the rain pat-pattering on the roof,
      the wind whistling at the window, and, faintly, in a distant quarter of
      the house, my cousin Elodie playing her exercises monotonously on the
      piano. I am balancing myself on tip-toe, craning my neck, with only one
      care, one preoccupation, in the world&mdash;to get a survey of the top
      shelf of the closet in the Colonel&rsquo;s room. The next to the top, and the
      next below that, I already command; they are vacant of everything save
      dust. But the top one is still above my head, and how to reach it seems a
      terribly vexed problem, of which, for a little while, motionless, with
      bent brows, I am rapt in meditation. And then, suddenly, I have an
      inspiration&mdash;I see my way.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not for nothing that my great-aunt Radigonde (think of having had a
      great-aunt named Radigonde, and yet never having seen her! She died before
      I was born&mdash;isn&rsquo;t Fate unkind?)&mdash;it was not for nothing that my
      great-aunt Radigonde, from 1820 till its extinction in 1838, had
      subscribed to the <i>Revue Rose&mdash;La Revue Rose; Echo du Bon Ton;
      Miroir de la Mode; paraissant tous les mois; dirigée par une Dame de la
      Cour</i>; nor was it in vain, either, that my great-aunt Radigonde had had
      the annual volumes of this fashionable intelligencer bound. Three or four
      of them now, piled one above the other on my chair, lent me the altitude I
      needed; and the top shelf yielded up its secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an abominably dusty secret, and it was quite a business to wipe it
      off. Then I perceived that it was a box, a square box, about eighteen
      inches long and half as deep, made of polished mahogany, inlaid with
      scrolls and flourishes of satin-wood. Opened, it proved to be a
      dressing-case. It was lined with pink velvet and white brocaded silk.
      There was a looking-glass, in a pink velvet frame, with an edge of gold
      lace, that swung up on a hinged support of tarnished ormolu; a sere and
      yellow looking-glass, that gave back a reluctant, filmy image of my face.
      There were half-a-dozen pear-shaped bottles, of wine-coloured glass, with
      tarnished gilt tops. There was a thing that looked like the paw of a small
      animal, the fur of which, at one end, was reddened, as if it had been
      rubbed in some red powder. The velvet straps that had once presumably held
      combs and brushes, had been despoiled by an earlier hand than mine; but of
      two pockets in the lid the treasures were intact: a tortoise-shell
      housewife, containing a pair of scissors, a thimble, and a bodkin, and a
      tortoise-shell purse, each prettily incrusted with silver and lined with
      thin pink silk.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front, between two of the gilt-topped bottles, an oval of pink velvet,
      with a tiny bird in ormolu perched upon it, was evidently movable&mdash;a
      cover to something. When I had lifted it, I saw, first, a little pane of
      glass, and then, through that, the brass cylinder and long steel comb of a
      musical box. Wasn&rsquo;t it an amiable conceit, whereby my lady should be
      entertained with tinkling harmonies the while her eyes and fingers were
      busied in the composition of her face? Was it a frequent one in old
      dressing-cases?
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, yes, the key was there&mdash;a gilt key, coquettishly decorated with a
      bow of pink ribbon; and when I had wound the mechanism up, the cylinder,
      to my great relief, began to turn&mdash;to my relief, for I had feared
      that the spring might be broken, or something; springs are so apt to be
      broken in this disappointing world. The cylinder began to turn&mdash;but,
      alas, in silence, or almost in silence, emitting only a faintly audible,
      rusty gr-r-r-r, a sort of guttural grumble; until, all at once, when I was
      least expecting it&mdash;tirala-tirala&mdash;it trilled out clearly,
      crisply, six silvery notes, and then relapsed into its rusty gr-r-r-r.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it would go on and on till it ran down. A minute or two of creaking and
      croaking, as it were, whilst it cleared its old asthmatic throat, then a
      sudden silvery tirala-tirala, then a catch, a cough, and
      mutter-mutter-mutter. Or was it more like an old woman maundering in her
      sleep, who should suddenly quaver out a snatch from a ditty of her
      girlhood, and afterwards mumble incoherently again?
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose the pin-points on the cylinder, all save just those six, were
      worn away; or, possibly, those teeth of the steel comb were the only ones
      that retained elasticity enough to vibrate.

      A sequence of six notes, as inconclusive as six words plucked at random
      from the middle of a sentence; as void of musical value as six such words
      would be of literary value. I wonder why it has always had this instant,
      irresistible power to move me. It has always been a talisman in my hands,
      a thing to conjure with. As when I was a child, so now, after twenty
      years, I have but to breathe it to myself, and, if I will, the actual
      world melts away, and I am journeying in dreamland. Whether I will or not,
      it always stirs a sad, sweet emotion in my heart. I wonder why.
      Tirala-tirala&mdash;I dare say, for another, any six notes, struck at
      haphazard, would signify as much. But for me&mdash;ah, if I could seize
      the sentiment it has for me, and translate it into English words, I should
      have achieved a sort of miracle. For me, it is the voice of a spirit,
      sighing something unutterable. It is an elixir, distilled of unearthly
      things, six lucent drops; I drink them, and I am transported into another
      atmosphere, and I see visions. It is Aladdin&rsquo;s lamp; I touch it, and
      cloud-capped towers and gorgeous palaces are mine in the twinkling of an
      eye. It is my wishing-cap, my magic-carpet, my key to the Castle of
      Enchantment.

      The Castle of Enchantment....
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was a child the Castle of Enchantment meant&mdash;the Future; the
      great mysterious Future, away, away there, beneath the uttermost horizon,
      where the sky is luminious with tints of rose and pearl; the ineffable
      Future, when I should be grownup, when I should be a Man, and when the
      world would be my garden, the world and life, and all their riches, mine
      to explore, to adventure in, to do as I pleased with! The Future and the
      World, the real World, the World that lay beyond our village, beyond the
      Forest of Granjolaye, farther than Bayonne, farther even than Pau; the
      World one read of and heard strange legends of: Paris, and Bagdad, and
      England, and Peru. Oh, how I longed to see it; how hard it was to wait;
      how desperately hard to think of the immense number of long years that
      must be worn through somehow, before it could come true.
    </p>
    <p>
      But&mdash;tirala-tirala!&mdash;my little broken bar of music was a
      touchstone. At the sound of it, at the thought of it, the Present was
      spirited away; Saint-Graal and all our countryside were left a thousand
      miles behind; and the Future and the World opened their portals to me, and
      I wandered in them where I would. In a sort of trance, with wide eyes and
      bated breath, I wandered in them, through enraptured hours. Believe me, it
      was a Future, it was a World, of quite unstinted magnificence. My
      many-pinnacled Castle of Enchantment was built of gold and silver, ivory,
      alabaster, and mother-of-pearl; the fountains in its courts ran with
      perfumed waters; and its pleasaunce was an orchard of pomegranates&mdash;one
      had no need to spare one&rsquo;s colours. I dare say, too, that it was rather
      vague, wrapped in a good deal of roseate haze, and of an architecture that
      could scarcely have been reduced to ground-plans and elevations; but what
      of that? And oh, the people, the people by whom the World and the Future
      were inhabited, the cavalcading knights, the beautiful princesses! And
      their virtues, and their graces, and their talents Î There were no ugly
      people, of course, no stupid people, no disagreeable people; everybody was
      young and handsome, gallant, generous, and splendidly dressed. And
      everybody was astonishingly nice to me, and it never seemed to occur to
      anybody that I wasn&rsquo;t to have my own way in everything. And I had it. Love
      and wealth, glory, and all manner of romance&mdash;I had them for the
      wishing. The stars left their courses to fight for me. And the winds of
      heaven vied with each other to prosper my galleons.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, it was nothing more nor other than the day-dream of every
      child. But it happened that that little accidental fragment of a phrase of
      music had a quite peculiar power to send me off dreaming it.

      I suppose it must be that we pass the Castle of Enchantment while we are
      asleep. For surely, at first, it is before us&mdash;we are moving towards
      it; we can see it shining in the distance; we shall reach it to-morrow,
      next week, next year. And then&mdash;and then, one morning, we wake up,
      and lo! it is behind us. We have passed it&mdash;we are sailing away from
      it&mdash;we can&rsquo;t turn back. We have passed the Castle of Enchantment! And
      yet, it was only to reach it that we made our weary voyage, toiling
      through hardships and perils and discouragements, forcing our impatient
      hearts to wait; it was only the hope, the certain hope, of reaching it at
      last, that made our toiling and our waiting possible. And now&mdash;we
      have passed it. We are sailing away from it. We can&rsquo;t turn back. We can
      only <i>look</i> back&mdash;with the bitterness that every heart knows. If
      we look forward, what is there to see, save grey waters, and then a
      darkness that we fear to enter?

      When I was a child, it was the great world and the future into which my
      talisman carried me, dreaming desirous dreams; the great world, all gold
      and marble, peopled by beautiful princesses and cavalcading knights; the
      future, when I should be grown-up, when I should be a Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I am grown-up now, and I have seen something of the great world&mdash;something
      of its gold and marble, its cavalcading knights and beautiful princesses.
      But if I care to dream desirous dreams, I touch my talisman, and wish
      myself back in the little world of my childhood. Tirala-tirala&mdash;I
      breathe it softly, softly; and the sentiment of my childhood comes and
      fills my room like a fragrance. I am at Saint-Graal again; and my
      grandmother is seated at her window, knitting; and André is bringing up
      the milk from the farm; and my cousin Elodie is playing her exercises on
      the piano; and Hélène and I are walking in the garden&mdash;Hélène in her
      short white frock, with a red sash, and her black hair loose down her
      back. All round us grow innumerable flowers, and innumerable birds are
      singing in the air, and the frogs are croaking, croaking in our pond. And
      farther off, the sun shines tranquilly on the chestnut-trees of the Forest
      of Granjolaye; and farther still, the Pyrenees gloom purple.... It is not
      much, perhaps it is not very wonderful; but oh, how my heart yearns to
      recover it, how it aches to realise that it never can.

      In the Morning (says Paraschkine) the Eastern Rim of the Earth was piled
      high with Emeralds and Rubies, as if the Gods had massed their Riches
      there; but he&mdash;ingenuous Pilgrim&mdash;who set forth to reach this
      Treasure-hoard, and to make the Gods&rsquo; Riches his, seemed presently to have
      lost his Way; he could no longer discern the faintest Glint of the Gems
      that had tempted him: until, in the Afternoon, chancing to turn his Head,
      he saw a bewildering Sight&mdash;the Emeralds and Rubies were behind him,
      immeasurably far behind, piled up in the West.

      <i>Where</i> is the Castle of Enchantment? <i>When</i> do we pass it? Ah,
      well, thank goodness, we all have talismans (like my little broken bit of
      a forgotten tune) whereby we are enabled sometimes to visit it in spirit,
      and to lose ourselves during enraptured moments among its glistening,
      labyrinthine halls.

      THE INVISIBLE PRINCE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t a masked ball
      given by the Countess Wohenhoffen, in Vienna, during carnival week, a year
      ago, a man draped in the embroidered silks of a Chinese mandarin, his
      features entirely concealed by an enormous Chinese head in cardboard, was
      standing in the Wintergarten, the big, dimly lighted conservatory, near
      the door of one of the gilt-and-white reception-rooms, rather a
      stolid-seeming witness of the multi-coloured romp within, when a voice
      behind him said, &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Field?&rdquo;&mdash;a woman&rsquo;s voice, an
      English voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mandarin turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a black mask, a pair of blue-grey eyes looked into his broad, bland
      Chinese face; and a black domino dropped him an extravagant little
      curtsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; he responded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m not Mr. Field; but I&rsquo;ll
      gladly pretend I am, if you&rsquo;ll stop and talk with me. I was dying for a
      little human conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re afraid you&rsquo;re not Mr. Field, are you?&rdquo; the mask replied
      derisively. &ldquo;Then why did you turn when I called his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t hope to disconcert me with questions like that,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I
      turned because I liked your voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He might quite reasonably have liked her voice, a delicate, clear, soft
      voice, somewhat high in register, with an accent, crisp, chiselled,
      concise, that suggested wit as well as distinction. She was rather tall,
      for a woman; one could divine her slender and graceful, under the
      voluminous folds of her domino.
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved a little away from the door, deeper into the conservatory. The
      mandarin kept beside her. There, amongst the palms, a <i>fontaine
      lumineuse</i> was playing, rhythmically changing colour. Now it was a
      shower of rubies; now of emeralds or amethysts, of sapphires, topazes, or
      opals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How pretty,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and how frightfully ingenious. I am wondering
      whether this wouldn&rsquo;t be a good place to sit down. What do you think?&rdquo; And
      she pointed with a fan to a rustic bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it would be no more than fair to give it a trial,&rdquo; he assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they sat down on the rustic bench, by the <i>fontaine lumineuse</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In view of your fear that you&rsquo;re not Mr. Field, it&rsquo;s rather a coincidence
      that at a masked ball in Vienna you should just happen to be English,
      isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, everybody&rsquo;s more or less English, in these days, you know,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some truth in that,&rdquo; she admitted, with a laugh. &ldquo;What a
      diverting piece of artifice this Wintergarten is, to be sure. Fancy
      arranging the electric lights to shine through a dome of purple glass, and
      look like stars. They do look like stars, don&rsquo;t they? Slightly
      over-dressed, showy stars, indeed; stars in the German taste; but stars,
      all the same. Then, by day, you know, the purple glass is removed, and you
      get the sun&mdash;the real sun. Do you notice the delicious fragrance of
      lilac? If one hadn&rsquo;t too exacting an imagination, one might almost
      persuade oneself that one was in a proper open-air garden, on a night in
      May.... Yes, everybody is more or less English, in these days. That&rsquo;s
      precisely the sort of thing I should have expected Victor Field to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By-the-bye,&rdquo; questioned the mandarin, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t mind increasing my
      stores of knowledge, who <i>is</i> this fellow Field?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This fellow Field? Ah, who indeed?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I wish
      you&rsquo;d tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you with pleasure, after you&rsquo;ve supplied me with the necessary
      data,&rdquo; he promised cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, by some accounts, he&rsquo;s a little literary man in London,&rdquo; she
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come! You never imagined that I was a little literary man in London,&rdquo;
       protested he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might be worse,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;However, if the phrase offends you,
      I&rsquo;ll say a rising young literary man, instead. He writes things, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor chap, does he? But then, that&rsquo;s a way they have, rising young
      literary persons?&rdquo; His tone was interrogative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;Poems and stories and things. And book reviews,
      I suspect. And even, perhaps, leading articles in the newspapers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Toute la lyre enfin?</i> What they call a penny-a-liner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s paid. I should think he&rsquo;d get rather more
      than a penny. He&rsquo;s fairly successful. The things he does aren&rsquo;t bad,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must look &rsquo;em up,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But meantime, will you tell me how you
      came to mistake me for him? Has he the Chinese type? Besides, what on
      earth should a little London literary man be doing at the Countess
      Wohenhoffen&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was standing near the door, over there,&rdquo; she told him, sweetly, &ldquo;dying
      for a little human conversation, till I took pity on him. No, he hasn&rsquo;t
      exactly the Chinese type, but he&rsquo;s wearing a Chinese costume, and I should
      suppose he&rsquo;d feel uncommonly hot in that exasperatingly placid Chinese
      head. <i>I&rsquo;m</i> nearly suffocated, and I&rsquo;m only wearing a <i>loup</i>.
      For the rest, why <i>shouldn&rsquo;t</i> he be here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your <i>loup</i> bothers you, pray take it off. Don&rsquo;t mind me,&rdquo; he
      urged gallantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re extremely good,&rdquo; she responded. &ldquo;But if I should take off my <i>loup</i>,
      you&rsquo;d be sorry. Of course, manlike, you&rsquo;re hoping that I&rsquo;m young and
      pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a perfect fright. I&rsquo;m an old maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. Manlike, I confess I <i>was</i> hoping you&rsquo;d be young and
      pretty. Now my hope has received the strongest confirmation. I&rsquo;m sure you
      are,&rdquo; he declared triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your argument, with a meretricious air of subtlety, is facile and
      superficial. Don&rsquo;t pin your faith to it. Why <i>shouldn&rsquo;t</i> Victor Field
      be here?&rdquo; she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Countess only receives tremendous swells. It&rsquo;s the most exclusive
      house in Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a tremendous swell?&rdquo; she wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; he asseverated. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed a little, and stroked her fan, a big fan of fluffy black
      feathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very jolly,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That thing in your lap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My fan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect you&rsquo;d call it a fan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake, what would <i>you</i> call it?&rdquo; cried she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should call it a fan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave another little laugh. &ldquo;You have a nice instinct for the <i>mot
      juste</i>,&rdquo; she informed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; he disclaimed, modestly. &ldquo;But I can call a fan a fan, when I
      think it won&rsquo;t shock the sensibilities of my hearer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the Countess only receives tremendous swells,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you must
      remember that Victor Field belongs to the Aristocracy of Talent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>quant à ça</i>, so, from the Wohenhoffens&rsquo; point of view, do the
      barber and the horse-leech. In this house, the Aristocracy of Talent dines
      with the butler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the Countess such a snob?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; she&rsquo;s an Austrian. They draw the line so absurdly tight in Austria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you leave me no alternative,&rdquo; she argued, &ldquo;but to conclude
      that Victor Field is a tremendous swell. Didn&rsquo;t you notice, I bobbed him a
      curtsey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took the curtsey as a tribute to my Oriental magnificence,&rdquo; he
      confessed. &ldquo;Field doesn&rsquo;t sound like an especially patrician name. I&rsquo;d
      give anything to discover who you are. Can&rsquo;t you be induced to tell me?
      I&rsquo;ll bribe, entreat, threaten&mdash;I&rsquo;ll do anything you think might
      persuade you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you at once, if you&rsquo;ll own up that you&rsquo;re Victor Field,&rdquo; said
      she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll own up that I&rsquo;m Queen Elizabeth if you&rsquo;ll tell me who you are.
      The end justifies the means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you <i>are</i> Victor Field?&rdquo; she pursued him eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind suborning perjury, why should I mind committing it?&rdquo; he
      reflected. &ldquo;Yes. And now, who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I must have an unequivocal avowal,&rdquo; she stipulated. &ldquo;Are you or are
      you not Victor Field?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us put it at this,&rdquo; he proposed, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m a good serviceable
      imitation; an excellent substitute when the genuine article is not
      procurable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, your real name isn&rsquo;t anything like Victor Field,&rdquo; she
      declared, pensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never said it was. But I admire the way in which you give with one hand
      and take back with the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your real name&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;Wait a moment... Yes, now I
      have it. Your real name... It&rsquo;s rather long. You don&rsquo;t think it will bore
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if it&rsquo;s really my real name, I daresay I&rsquo;m hardened to it,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your real name is Louis Charles Ferdinand Stanislas John Joseph Emmanuel
      Maria Anna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy upon me,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;what a name! You ought to have broken it to me
      in instalments. And it&rsquo;s all Christian name at that. Can&rsquo;t you spare me
      just a little rag of a surname, for decency&rsquo;s sake?&rdquo; he pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The surnames of royalties don&rsquo;t matter, Monseigneur,&rdquo; she said, with a
      flourish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Royalties? What? Dear me, here&rsquo;s rapid promotion! I am royal now! And a
      moment ago I was a little penny-a-liner in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>L&rsquo;un n&rsquo;empêche pas l&rsquo;autre</i>. Have you never heard the story of the
      Invisible Prince?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I adore irrelevancy,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I seem to have read something about an
      invisible prince, when I was young. A fairy tale, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The irrelevancy is only apparent. The story I mean is a story of real
      life. Have you ever heard of the Duke of Zeln?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zeln? Zeln?&rdquo; he repeated, reflectively. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She clapped her hands. &ldquo;Really, you do it admirably. If I weren&rsquo;t
      perfectly sure of my facts, I believe I should be taken in. Zeln, as any
      history would tell you, as any old atlas would show you, was a little
      independent duchy in the centre of Germany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor dear thing! Like Jonah in the centre of the whale,&rdquo; he murmured,
      sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush. Don&rsquo;t interrupt. Zeln was a little independent German duchy, and
      the Duke of Zeln was its sovereign. After the war with France it was
      absorbed by Prussia. But the ducal family still rank as royal highnesses.
      Of course, you&rsquo;ve heard of the Leczinskis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lecz&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-what?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leczinski,&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you spell it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;L&mdash;e&mdash;c&mdash;z&mdash;i&mdash;n&mdash;s&mdash;k&mdash;i.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. Capital. You have a real gift for spelling,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be quiet,&rdquo; she said, severely, &ldquo;and answer my question? Are you
      familiar with the name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should never venture to be familiar with a name I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he
      asserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you don&rsquo;t know it? You have never heard of Stanislas Leczinski, who
      was king of Poland? Of Marie Leczinska, who married Louis XV.?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to be sure. I remember. The lady whose portrait one sees at
      Versailles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so. Very well,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;the last representative of the
      Leczinskis, in the elder line, was the Princess Anna Leczinska, who, in
      1858, married the Duke of Zeln. She was the daughter of John Leczinski,
      Duke of Grodnia and Governor of Galicia, and of the Archduchess Henrietta
      d&rsquo;.ste, a cousin of the Emperor of Austria. She was also a great heiress,
      and an extremely handsome woman. But the Duke of Zeln was a bad lot, a
      viveur, a gambler, a spendthrift. His wife, like a fool, made her entire
      fortune over to him, and he proceeded to play ducks and drakes with it. By
      the time their son was born he&rsquo;d got rid of the last farthing. Their son
      wasn&rsquo;t born till &rsquo;63, five years after their marriage. Well, and then,
      what do you suppose the Duke did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reformed, of course. The wicked husband always reforms when a child is
      born, and there&rsquo;s no more money,&rdquo; he generalised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know perfectly well what he did,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;He petitioned the German
      Diet to annul the marriage. You see, having exhausted the dowry of the
      Princess Anna, it occurred to him that if she could only be got out of the
      way, he might marry another heiress, and have the spending of another
      fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clever dodge,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Did it come off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It came off, all too well. He based his petition on the ground that the
      marriage had never been.... I forget what the technical term is. Anyhow,
      he pretended that the princess had never been his wife except in name, and
      that the child couldn&rsquo;t possibly be his. The Emperor of Austria stood by
      his connection, like the loyal gentleman he is; used every scrap of
      influence he possessed to help her. But the duke, who was a Protestant
      (the princess was of course a Catholic), the duke persuaded all the
      Protestant States in the Diet to vote in his favour. The Emperor of
      Austria was powerless, the Pope was powerless. And the Diet annulled the
      marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the mandarin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;The marriage was annulled, and the child declared
      illegitimate. Ernest Augustus, as the duke was somewhat inconsequently
      named, married again, and had other children, the eldest of whom is the
      present bearer of the title&mdash;the same Duke of Zeln one hears of,
      quarrelling with the croupiers at Monte Carlo. The Princess Anna, with her
      baby, came to Austria. The Emperor gave her a pension, and lent her one of
      his country houses to live in&mdash;Schloss Sanct-Andreas. Our hostess,
      by-the-bye, the Countess Wohenhoffen, was her intimate friend and her <i>première
      dame d&rsquo;honneur</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the mandarin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the poor princess had suffered more than she could bear. She died
      when her child was four years old. The Countess Wohenhoffen took the
      infant, by the Emperor&rsquo;s desire, and brought him up with her own son
      Peter. He was called Prince Louis Leczinski. Of course, in all moral
      right, he was the Hereditary Prince of Zeln. His legitimacy, for the rest,
      and his mother&rsquo;s innocence, are perfectly well established, in every sense
      but a legal sense, by the fact that he has all the physical
      characteristics of the Zeln stock. He has the Zeln nose and the Zeln chin,
      which are as distinctive as the Habsburg lip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, for the poor young man&rsquo;s sake, though, that they&rsquo;re not so
      unbecoming?&rdquo; questioned the mandarin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not exactly pretty,&rdquo; answered the mask. &ldquo;The nose is a thought
      too long, the chin is a trifle too short. However, I daresay the poor
      young man is satisfied. As I was about to tell you, the Countess
      Wohenhoflen brought him up, and the Emperor destined him for the Church.
      He even went to Rome and entered the Austrian College. He&rsquo;d have been on
      the high road to a cardinalate by this time if he&rsquo;d stuck to the
      priesthood, for he had strong interest. But, lo and behold, when he was
      about twenty, he chucked the whole thing up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah? <i>Histoire de femme?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; she assented, &ldquo;though I&rsquo;ve never heard any one say so. At
      all events, he left Rome, and started upon his travels. He had no money of
      his own, but the Emperor made him an allowance. He started upon his
      travels, and he went to India, and he went to America, and he went to
      South Africa, and then, finally, in &rsquo;87 or &rsquo;88, he went&mdash;no one knows
      where. He totally disappeared, vanished into space. He&rsquo;s not been heard of
      since. Some people think he&rsquo;s dead. But the greater number suppose that he
      tired of his false position in the world, and one fine day determined to
      escape from it, by sinking his identity, changing his name, and going in
      for a new life under new conditions. They call him the Invisible Prince.
      His position <i>was</i> rather an ambiguous one, wasn&rsquo;t it? You see, he
      was neither one thing nor the other. He had no <i>état-civil</i>. In the
      eyes of the law he was a bastard, yet he knew himself to be the legitimate
      son of the Duke of Zeln. He was a citizen of no country, yet he was the
      rightful heir to a throne. He was the last descendant of Stanislas
      Leczinski, yet it was without authority that he bore his name. And then,
      of course, the rights and wrongs of the matter were only known to a few.
      The majority of people simply remembered that there had been a scandal.
      And (as a wag once said of him) wherever he went, he left his mother&rsquo;s
      reputation behind him. No wonder he found the situation irksome. Well,
      there is the story of the Invisible Prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a very exciting, melodramatic little story, too. For my part, I
      suspect your Prince met a boojum. I love to listen to stories. Won&rsquo;t you
      tell me another? Do, please,&rdquo; he pressed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t meet a boojum,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;He went to England, and set
      up for an author. The Invisible Prince and Victor Field are one and the
      same person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say! Not really!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, really.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo; he wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;To begin with, I must confide to you that
      Victor Field is a man I&rsquo;ve never met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never met...?&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;But, by the blithe way in which you were
      laying his sins at my door, a little while ago, I supposed you were sworn
      confederates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of masked balls, if you can&rsquo;t talk to people you&rsquo;ve never
      met?&rdquo; she submitted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never met him, but I&rsquo;m one of his admirers. I
      like his little poems. And I&rsquo;m the happy possessor of a portrait of him.
      It&rsquo;s a print after a photograph. I cut it from an illustrated paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really almost wish I <i>was</i> Victor Field,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;I should
      feel such a glow of gratified vanity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Countess Wohenhoffen,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;has at least twenty portraits
      of the Invisible Prince&mdash;photographs, miniatures, life-size
      paintings, taken from the time he was born, almost, to the time of his
      disappearance. Victor Field and Louis Leczinski have countenances as like
      each other as two halfpence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An accidental resemblance, doubtless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t an accidental resemblance,&rdquo; she affirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then you think it&rsquo;s intentional?&rdquo; he quizzed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be absurd. I might have thought it accidental, except for one or
      two odd little circumstances. <i>Primo</i>, Victor Field is a guest at the
      Wohenhoffens&rsquo; ball.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he <i>is</i> a guest here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are wondering how I know. Nothing simpler.
      The same costumier who made my domino, supplied his Chinese dress. I
      noticed it at his shop. It struck me as rather nice, and I asked whom it
      was for. The costumier said, for an Englishman at the Hôtel de Bade. Then
      he looked in his book, and told me the Englishman&rsquo;s name. It was Victor
      Field. So, when I saw the same Chinese dress here to-night, I knew it
      covered the person of one of my favourite authors. But I own, like you, I
      was a good deal surprised. What on earth should a little London literary
      man be doing at the Countess Wohenhoffen&rsquo;s? And then I remembered the
      astonishing resemblance between Victor Field and Louis Leczinski; and I
      remembered that to Louis Leczinski the Countess Wohenhoffen had been a
      second mother; and I reflected that though he chose to be as one dead and
      buried for the rest of the world, Louis Leczinski might very probably keep
      up private relations with the Countess. He might very probably come to her
      ball, incognito, and safely masked. I observed also that the Countess&rsquo;s
      rooms were decorated throughout with <i>white lilac</i>. But the white
      lilac is the emblematic flower of the Leczinskis; green and white are
      their family colours. Wasn&rsquo;t the choice of white lilac on this occasion
      perhaps designed as a secret compliment to the Prince? I was taught in the
      schoolroom that two and two make four.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, one can see that you&rsquo;ve enjoyed a liberal education,&rdquo; he apprised
      her. &ldquo;But where were you taught to jump to conclusions? You do it with a
      grace, an assurance. I too have heard that two and two make four; but
      first you must catch your two and two. Really, as if there couldn&rsquo;t be
      more than one Chinese costume knocking about Vienna, during carnival week!
      Dear, good, sweet lady, it&rsquo;s of all disguises the disguise they&rsquo;re driving
      hardest, this particular season. And then to build up an elaborate theory
      of identities upon the mere chance resemblance of a pair of photographs!
      Photographs indeed! Photographs don&rsquo;t give the complexion. Say that your
      Invisible Prince is dark, what&rsquo;s to prevent your literary man from being
      fair or sandy? Or <i>vice versa?</i> And then, how is a little German
      Polish princeling to write poems and things in English? No, no, no; your
      reasoning hasn&rsquo;t a leg to stand on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind its not having legs,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;so long as it
      convinces me. As for writing poems and things in English, you yourself
      said that everybody is more or less English, in these days. German princes
      are especially so. They all learn English, as a second mother-tongue. You
      see, like Circassian beauties, they are mostly bred up for the marriage
      market; and nothing is a greater help towards a good sound remunerative
      English marriage, than a knowledge of the language. However, don&rsquo;t be
      frightened. I must take it for granted that Victor Field would prefer not
      to let the world know who he is. I happen to have discovered his secret.
      He may trust to my discretion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You still persist in imagining that I&rsquo;m Victor Field?&rdquo; he murmured sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have to be extremely simple-minded,&rdquo; she announced, &ldquo;to imagine
      anything else. You wouldn&rsquo;t be a male human being if you had sat here for
      half an hour patiently talking about another man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your argument,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;with a meretricious air of subtlety, is facile
      and superficial. I thank you for teaching me that word. I&rsquo;d sit here till
      doomsday talking about my worst enemy, for the pleasure of talking with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps we have been talking of your worst enemy. Whom do the moralists
      pretend a man&rsquo;s worst enemy is wont to be?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would tell me the name of the person the moralists would
      consider your worst enemy,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you directly, as I said before, if you&rsquo;ll own up,&rdquo; she offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your price is prohibitive. I&rsquo;ve nothing to own up to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then&mdash;good night,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lightly, swiftly, she fled from the conservatory, and was soon
      irrecoverable in the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Victor Field left Vienna for London; but before he left
      he wrote a letter to Peter Wohenhoffen. In the course of it he said:
      &ldquo;There was an Englishwoman at your ball last night with the reasoning
      powers of a detective in a novel. By divers processes of elimination and
      induction, she had formed all sorts of theories about no end of things.
      Among others, for instance, he was willing to bet her hali-dome that a
      certain Prince Louis Leczinski, who seems to have gone on the spree some
      years ago, and never to have come home again&mdash;she was willing to bet
      anything you like that Leczinski and I&mdash;moi qui vous parle&mdash;were
      to all intents and purposes the same. Who was she, please? Rather a tall
      woman, in a black domino, with grey eyes, or greyish-blue, and a nice
      voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the answer which he received from Peter Wohenhoffen towards the end of
      the week, Peter said: &ldquo;There were nineteen Englishwomen at my mother&rsquo;s
      party, all of them rather tall, with nice voices, and grey or blue-grey
      eyes. I don&rsquo;t know what colours their dominoes were. Here is a list of
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The names that followed were names of people whom Victor Field almost
      certainly would never meet. The people Victor knew in London were the sort
      of people a little literary man might be expected to know. Most of them
      were respectable; some of them even deemed themselves rather smart, and
      patronised him right Britishly. But the nineteen names in Peter
      Wohenhoffen&rsquo;s list (&rdquo;Oh, me! Oh, my!&rdquo; cried Victor) were names to make you
      gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the same, he went a good deal to Hyde Park during the season, and
      watched the driving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which of all those haughty high-born beauties is she?&rdquo; he wondered
      futilely.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the season passed, and then the year; and little by little, of
      course, he ceased to think about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon last May, a man, habited in accordance with the fashion of
      the period, stopped before a hairdresser&rsquo;s shop in Knightsbridge
      somewhere, and, raising his hat, bowed to the three waxen ladies who
      simpered from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! It&rsquo;s Mr. Field!&rdquo; a voice behind him cried. &ldquo;What are those cryptic
      rites that you&rsquo;re performing? What on earth are you bowing into a
      hairdresser&rsquo;s window for?&rdquo;&mdash;a smooth, melodious voice, tinged by an
      inflection that was half ironical, half bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was saluting the type of English beauty,&rdquo; he answered, turning.
      &ldquo;Fortunately, there are divergencies from it,&rdquo; he added, as he met the
      puzzled smile of his interlocutrice; a puzzled smile indeed, but, like the
      voice, by no means without its touch of irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a little laugh; and then, examining the models critically, &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;
       she questioned. &ldquo;Would you call that the type? You place the type high.
      Their features are quite faultless, and who ever saw such complexions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the type, all the same,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Just as the imitation marionette
      is the type of English breeding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The imitation marionette? I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t follow,&rdquo; she confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The imitation marionettes. You&rsquo;ve seen them at little theatres in Italy.
      They&rsquo;re actors who imitate puppets. Men and women who try to behave as if
      they weren&rsquo;t human, as if they were made of starch and whalebone, instead
      of flesh and blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; she assented, with another little laugh. &ldquo;That would be rather
      typical of our insular methods. But do you know what an engaging, what a
      reviving spectacle you presented, as you stood there flourishing your hat?
      What do you imagine people thought? And what would have happened to you if
      I had just chanced to be a policeman instead of a friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you have clapped your handcuffs on me?&rdquo; he enquired. &ldquo;I suppose my
      conduct did seem rather suspicious. I was in the deepest depth of
      dejection. One must give some expression to one&rsquo;s sorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going towards Kensington?&rdquo; she asked, preparing to move on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I commit myself, I should like to be sure whether you are,&rdquo; he
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can easily discover with a little perseverance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He placed himself beside her, and together they walked towards Kensington.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was rather taller than the usual woman, and slender. She was
      exceedingly well-dressed; smartly, becomingly; a jaunty little hat of
      strangely twisted straw, with an aigrette springing defiantly from it; a
      jacket covered with mazes and labyrinths of embroidery; at her throat a
      big knot of white lace, the ends of which fell winding in a creamy cascade
      to her waist (do they call the thing a <i>jabot?</i>); and then....
    </p>
    <p>
      But what can a man trust himself to write of these esoteric matters? She
      carried herself extremely well, too: with grace, with distinction, her
      head held high, even thrown back a little, superciliously. She had an
      immense quantity of very lovely hair. Red hair? Yellow hair? Red hair with
      yellow lights burning in it? Yellow hair with red fires shimmering through
      it? In a single loose, full billow it swept away from her forehead, and
      then flowed into half-a-thousand rippling, crinkling, capricious
      undulations. And her skin had the sensitive colouring, the fineness of
      texture, that are apt to accompany red hair when it&rsquo;s yellow, yellow hair
      when it&rsquo;s red. Her face, with its pensive, quizzical eyes, it&rsquo;s tip-tilted
      nose, it&rsquo;s rather large mouth, and the little mocking quirks and curves
      the lips took, was an alert, arch, witty face; a delicate high-bred face;
      and withal a somewhat sensuous, emotional face; the face of a woman with a
      vast deal of humour in her soul, a vast deal of mischief; of a woman who
      would love to tease you, and mystify you, and lead you on, and put you
      off; and yet who, in her own way, at her own time, would know supremely
      well how to be kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was mischief rather than kindness that glimmered in her eyes at
      present, as she asked, &ldquo;You were in the deepest depths of dejection. Poor
      man! Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t precisely determine,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;whether the sympathy that seems
      to vibrate in your voice is genuine or counterfeit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s half and half,&rdquo; she suggested. &ldquo;But my curiosity is unmixed.
      Tell me your troubles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The catalogue is long. I&rsquo;ve sixteen hundred million. The weather, for
      example. The shameless beauty of this radiant spring day. It&rsquo;s enough to
      stir all manner of wild pangs and longings in the heart of an
      octogenarian. But, anyhow, when one&rsquo;s life is passed in a dungeon, one
      can&rsquo;t perpetually be singing and dancing from mere exuberance of joy, can
      one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your life passed in a dungeon?&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, indeed, it is. Isn&rsquo;t yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It had never occurred to me that it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky. Mine is passed in the dungeons of Castle Ennui,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Castle Ennui. Ah, yes. You mean you&rsquo;re bored?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this particular moment I&rsquo;m savouring the most exquisite excitement,&rdquo;
       he professed. &ldquo;But in general, when I am not working or sleeping, I&rsquo;m
      bored to extermination&mdash;incomparably bored. If only one could work
      and sleep alternately, twenty-four hours a day, the year round! There&rsquo;s no
      use trying to play in London. It&rsquo;s so hard to find a playmate. The English
      people take their pleasures without salt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dungeons of Castle Ennui,&rdquo; she repeated meditatively. &ldquo;Yes, we are
      fellow-prisoners. I&rsquo;m bored to extermination too. Still,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;one
      is allowed out on parole, now and again. And sometimes one has really
      quite delightful little experiences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would ill become me, in the present circumstances, to dispute that,&rdquo;
       he answered, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the castle waits to reclaim us afterwards, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she mused.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather a happy image, Castle Ennui.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m extremely glad you approve of it. Castle Ennui is the Bastille of
      modern life. It is built of prunes and prisms; it has its outer court of
      Convention, and its inner court of Propriety; it is moated round by
      Respectability, and the shackles its inmates wear are forged of dull
      little duties and arbitrary little rules. You can only escape from it at
      the risk of breaking your social neck, or remaining a fugitive from social
      justice to the end of your days. Yes, it is a fairly decent little image.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bit out of something you&rsquo;re preparing for the press?&rdquo; she hinted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how unkind of you!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It was absolutely extemporaneous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can never tell, with <i>vous autres gens-de-lettres</i>&ldquo; she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be friendlier to say <i>nous autres gens desprit</i>,&rsquo; he
      submitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we proving to what degree <i>nous autres gens d&rsquo;esprit sont bêtes</i>,&rdquo;
       she remarked, &ldquo;by continuing to walk along this narrow pavement, when we
      can get into Kensington Gardens by merely crossing the street? Would it
      take you out of your way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no way. I was sauntering for pleasure, if you can believe me. I
      wish I could hope that you have no way either. Then we could stop here,
      and crack little jokes together the livelong afternoon,&rdquo; he said, as they
      entered the Gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, my way leads straight back to the Castle. I&rsquo;ve promised to call on
      an old woman in Campden Hill,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disappoint her. It&rsquo;s good for old women to be disappointed. It whips up
      their circulation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t much regret disappointing the old woman,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;and
      I should rather like an hour or two of stolen freedom. I don&rsquo;t mind owning
      that I&rsquo;ve generally found you, as men go, a moderately interesting man to
      talk with. But the deuce of it is... You permit the expression?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m devoted to the expression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce of it is, I&rsquo;m supposed to be driving,&rdquo; she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that doesn&rsquo;t matter. So many suppositions in this world are
      baseless,&rdquo; he reminded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s the prison van,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the tiresome rules in
      the female wing of Castle Ennui that you&rsquo;re always supposed, more or less,
      to be driving. And though you may cheat the authorities by slipping out of
      the prison van directly it&rsquo;s turned the corner, and sending it on ahead,
      there it remains, a factor that can&rsquo;t be eliminated. The prison van will
      relentlessly await my arrival in the old woman&rsquo;s street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That only adds to the sport. Let it wait. When a factor can&rsquo;t be
      eliminated, it should be haughtily ignored. Besides, there are higher
      considerations. If you leave me, what shall I do with the rest of this
      weary day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can go to your club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw up his hand. &ldquo;Merciful lady! What sin have I committed? I never
      go to my club, except when I&rsquo;ve been wicked, as a penance. If you will
      permit me to employ a metaphor&mdash;oh, but a tried and trusty metaphor&mdash;when
      one ship on the sea meets another in distress, it stops and comforts it,
      and forgets all about its previous engagements and the prison van and
      everything. Shall we cross to the north, and see whether the Serpentine is
      in its place? Or would you prefer to inspect the eastern front of the
      Palace? Or may I offer you a penny chair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think a penny chair would be the maddest of the three dissipations,&rdquo;
       she decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they sat down in penny chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather jolly here, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The trees, with their black
      trunks, and their leaves, and things. Have you ever seen such sumptuous
      foliage? And the greensward, and the shadows, and the sunlight, and the
      atmosphere, and the mistiness&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it like pearl-dust and gold-dust
      floating in the air? It&rsquo;s all got up to imitate the background of a
      Watteau. We must do our best to be frivolous and ribald, and supply a
      proper foreground. How big and fleecy and white the clouds are. Do you
      think they&rsquo;re made of cotton-wool? And what do you suppose they paint the
      sky with? There never was such a brilliant, breath-taking blue. It&rsquo;s much
      too nice to be natural. And they&rsquo;ve sprinkled the whole place with scent,
      haven&rsquo;t they? You notice how fresh and sweet it smells. If only one could
      get rid of the sparrows&mdash;the cynical little beasts! hear how they&rsquo;re
      chortling&mdash;and the people, and the nursemaids and children. I have
      never been able to understand why they admit the public to the parks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; she encouraged him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re succeeding admirably in your effort
      to be ribald.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that last remark wasn&rsquo;t ribald in the least&mdash;it was desperately
      sincere. I do think it&rsquo;s inconsiderate of them to admit the public to the
      parks. They ought to exclude all the lower classes, the People, at one
      fell swoop, and then to discriminate tremendously amongst the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy, what undemocratic sentiments!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;The People, the poor
      dear People&mdash;what have they done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything. What haven&rsquo;t they done? One could forgive their being dirty
      and stupid and noisy and rude; one could forgive their ugliness, the
      ineffable banality of their faces, their goggle-eyes, their protruding
      teeth, their ungainly motions; but the trait one can&rsquo;t forgive is their
      venality. They&rsquo;re so mercenary. They&rsquo;re always thinking how much they can
      get out of you&mdash;everlastingly touching their hats and expecting you
      to put your hand in your pocket. Oh, no, believe me, there&rsquo;s no health in
      the People. Ground down under the iron heel of despotism, reduced to a
      condition of hopeless serfdom, I don&rsquo;t say that they might not develop
      redeeming virtues. But free, but sovereign, as they are in these days,
      they&rsquo;re everything that is squalid and sordid and offensive. Besides, they
      read such abominably bad literature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that particular they&rsquo;re curiously like the aristocracy, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
       said she. &ldquo;By-the-bye, when are you going to publish another book of
      poems?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apropos of bad literature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not altogether bad. I rather like your poems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s useless to pretend that we haven&rsquo;t tastes in
      common.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were both silent for a bit. She looked at him oddly, an inscrutable
      little light flickering in her eyes. All at once she broke out with a
      merry trill of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hugely amused,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t aware that I&rsquo;d said anything especially good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re building better than you know. But if I am amused, <i>you</i> look
      ripe for tears. What is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every heart knows its own bitterness,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pay the least
      attention to me. You mustn&rsquo;t let moodiness of mine cast a blight upon your
      high spirits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No fear,&rdquo; she assured him. &ldquo;There are pleasures that nothing can rob of
      their sweetness. Life is not all dust and ashes. There are bright spots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve no doubt there are,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thrilling little adventures&mdash;no?&rdquo; she questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the bold, I dare say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None but the bold deserve them. Sometimes it&rsquo;s one thing, and sometimes
      it&rsquo;s another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very certain,&rdquo; he agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes, for instance,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;one meets a man one knows, and
      speaks to him. And he answers with a glibness! And then, almost directly,
      what do you suppose one discovers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One discovers that the wretch hasn&rsquo;t the ghost of a notion who one is&mdash;that
      he&rsquo;s totally and absolutely forgotten one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say! Really?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, really. You can&rsquo;t deny that <i>that&rsquo;s</i> an exhilarating little
      adventure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it might be. One could enjoy the man&rsquo;s embarrassment,&rdquo; he
      reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or his lack of embarrassment. Some men are of an assurance, of a <i>sang
      froid!</i> They&rsquo;ll place themselves beside you, and walk with you, and
      talk with you, and even propose that you should pass the livelong
      afternoon cracking jokes with them in a garden, and never breathe a hint
      of their perplexity. They&rsquo;ll brazen it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s distinctly heroic, Spartan, of them, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Internally, poor dears, they&rsquo;re very likely suffering agonies of
      discomfiture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hope they are. Could they decently do less?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And fancy the mental struggles that must be going on in their brains,&rdquo; he
      urged. &ldquo;If I were a man in such a situation I&rsquo;d throw myself upon the
      woman&rsquo;s mercy. I&rsquo;d say, &rsquo;Beautiful, sweet lady! I know I know you. Your
      name, your entirely charming and appropriate name, is trembling on the tip
      of my tongue. But, for some unaccountable reason, my brute of a memory
      chooses to play the fool. If you&rsquo;ve a spark of Christian kindness in your
      soul, you&rsquo;ll come to my rescue with a little clue.&rsquo;.rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the woman had a Christian sense of the ridiculous in her soul, I fear
      you&rsquo;d throw yourself on her mercy in vain,&rdquo; she warned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>is</i> the good of tantalising people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;the woman might reasonably feel slightly
      humiliated to find herself forgotten in that bare-faced manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The humiliation surely would be all the man&rsquo;s. Have you heard from the
      Wohenhoffens lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The&mdash;what? The&mdash;who?&rdquo; She raised her eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Wohenhoffens,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are the Wohenhoffens? Are they persons? Are they things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing. My enquiry was merely dictated by a thirst for knowledge. It
      occurred to me vaguely that you might have worn a black domino at a masked
      ball they gave, the Wohenhoffens. Are you sure you didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a great mind to punish your forgetfulness by pretending that I did,&rdquo;
       she teased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was rather tall, like you, and she had grey eyes, and a nice voice,
      and a laugh that was sweeter than the singing of nightingales. She was
      monstrously clever, too, with a flow of language that would have made her
      a leader in any sphere. She was also a perfect fiend. I have always been
      anxious to meet her again, in order that I might ask her to marry me. I&rsquo;m
      strongly disposed to believe that she was you. Was she?&rdquo; he pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I say yes, will you at once proceed to ask me to marry you?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try it and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ce n&rsquo;est pas la peine</i>. It occasionally happens that a woman&rsquo;s
      already got a husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said she was an old maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you dare to insinuate that I look like an old maid?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you wish me to insinuate that you look like anything so insipid as
      a young girl? <i>Were</i> you the woman of the black domino?&rdquo; he
      persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should need further information, before being able to make up my mind.
      Are the&mdash;what&rsquo;s their name?&mdash;Wohenheimer?&mdash;are the
      Wohenheimers people one can safely confess to knowing? Oh, you&rsquo;re a man,
      and don&rsquo;t count. But a woman? It sounds a trifle Jewish, Wohenheimer. But
      of course there are Jews and Jews.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re playing with me like the cat in the adage,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too
      cruel. No one is responsible for his memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to think that this man took me down to dinner not two months ago!&rdquo;
       she murmured in her veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re as hard as nails. In whose house? Or&mdash;stay. Prompt me a
      little. Tell me the first syllable of your name. Then the rest will come
      with a rush.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Matilda Muggins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a great mind to punish your untruthfulness by pretending to believe
      you,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Have you really got a husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you doubt it?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it. Have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know whether you&rsquo;ve got a husband?&rdquo; he protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d better let you believe. Yes, on the whole, I think
      you may as well assume that I&rsquo;ve got a husband,&rdquo; she concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a lover, too?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really! I like your impertinence!&rdquo; She bridled. &ldquo;I only asked to show a
      polite interest. I knew the answer would be an indignant negative. You&rsquo;re
      an Englishwoman, and you&rsquo;re <i>nice</i>. Oh, one can see with half an eye
      that you&rsquo;re <i>nice</i>. But that a nice Englishwoman should have a lover
      is as inconceivable as that she should have side-whiskers. It&rsquo;s only the
      reg&rsquo;lar bad-uns in England who have lovers. There&rsquo;s nothing between the
      family pew and the divorce court. One nice Englishwoman is a match for the
      whole Eleven Thousand Virgins of Cologne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To hear you talk, one might fancy you were not English yourself. For a
      man of the name of Field, you&rsquo;re uncommonly foreign. You <i>look</i>
      rather foreign too, you know, by-the-bye. You haven&rsquo;t at all an English
      cast of countenance,&rdquo; she considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve enjoyed the advantages of a foreign education. I was brought up
      abroad,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where your features unconsciously assimilated themselves to a foreign
      type? Where you learned a hundred thousand strange little foreign things,
      no doubt? And imbibed a hundred thousand unprincipled little foreign
      notions? And all the ingenuous little foreign prejudices and
      misconceptions concerning England?&rdquo; she questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most of them,&rdquo; he assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Perfide Albion?</i> English hypocrisy?&rdquo; she pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, the English are consummate hypocrites. But there&rsquo;s only one
      objection to their hypocrisy&mdash;it so rarely covers any wickedness.
      It&rsquo;s such a disappointment to see a creature stalking towards you,
      laboriously draped in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, and then to discover that it&rsquo;s
      only a sheep. You, for instance, as I took the liberty of intimating a
      moment ago, in spite of your perfectly respectable appearance, are a
      perfectly respectable woman. If you weren&rsquo;t, wouldn&rsquo;t I be making furious
      love to you, though!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I am, I can see no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t make furious love to me,
      if it would amuse you. There&rsquo;s no harm in firing your pistol at a person
      who&rsquo;s bullet-proof,&rdquo; she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it&rsquo;s merely a wanton waste of powder and shot,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;However, I
      shouldn&rsquo;t stick at that. The deuce of it is.... You permit the
      expression?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m devoted to the expression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce of it is, you profess to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say that you, with your unprincipled foreign notions,
      would be restrained by any such consideration as that?&rdquo; she wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be for an instant&mdash;if I weren&rsquo;t in love with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Comment donc? Déjà?</i>&rdquo; she cried with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>déjà!</i> Why not? Consider the weather&mdash;consider the scene.
      Is the air soft, is it fragrant? Look at the sky&mdash;good heavens!&mdash;and
      the clouds, and the shadows on the grass, and the sunshine between the
      trees. The world is made of light today, of light and colour, and perfume
      and music. <i>Tutt&rsquo; intorno canta amort amor, amore!</i> What would you
      have? One recognises one&rsquo;s affinity. One doesn&rsquo;t need a lifetime. You
      began the business at the Wohenhoffens&rsquo; ball. To-day you&rsquo;ve merely put on
      the finishing touches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then I <i>am</i> the woman you met at the masked ball?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look me in the eye, and tell me you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; he defied her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the faintest interest in telling you I&rsquo;m not. On the contrary,
      it rather pleases me to let you imagine that I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She owed me a grudge, you know. I hoodwinked her like everything,&rdquo; he
      confided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, did you? Then, as a sister woman, I should be glad to serve as her
      instrument of vengeance. Do you happen to have such a thing as a watch
      about you?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be good enough to tell me what o&rsquo;clock it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are your motives for asking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m expected at home at five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are the motives for asking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to call upon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might wait till you&rsquo;re invited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, invite me&mdash;quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, never, never,&rdquo; she asseverated. &ldquo;A man who&rsquo;s forgotten me as you
      have!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I&rsquo;ve only met you once at a masked ball........&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you be brought to realise that every time you mistake me for that
      woman of the masked ball you turn the dagger in the wound?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you won&rsquo;t invite me to call upon you, how and when am I to see you
      again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t an idea,&rdquo; she answered, cheerfully. &ldquo;I must go now. Good bye.&rdquo;
       She rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; he interposed. &ldquo;Before you go will you allow me to look at
      the palm of your left hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell fortunes. I&rsquo;m extremely good at it,&rdquo; he boasted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell
      you yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; she assented, sitting down again: and guilelessly she
      pulled off her glove.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand, a beautifully slender, nervous hand, warm and soft, with
      rosy, tapering fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho! you <i>are</i> an old maid after all,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no wedding
      ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You villain!&rdquo; she gasped, snatching the hand away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promised to tell your fortune. Haven&rsquo;t I told it correctly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t rub it in, though. Eccentric old maids don&rsquo;t like to be
      reminded of their condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you marry <i>me?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partly from curiosity. Partly because it&rsquo;s the only way I can think of,
      to make sure of seeing you again. And then, I like your hair. Will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stars forbid. And I&rsquo;m ambitious. In my horoscope it is written that I
      shall either never marry at all, or&mdash;marry royalty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bother ambition! Cheat your horoscope. Marry me. Will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you care to follow me,&rdquo; she said, rising again, &ldquo;you can come and help
      me to commit a little theft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He followed her to an obscure and sheltered corner of a flowery path,
      where she stopped before a bush of white lilac.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no keepers in sight, are there?&rdquo; she questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then allow me to make you a receiver of stolen goods,&rdquo; said she, breaking
      off a spray, and handing it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. But I&rsquo;d rather have an answer to my question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that an answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White lilac&mdash;to the Invisible Prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Invisible Prince.... Then you <i>are</i> the black domino!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I suppose so,&rdquo; she consented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you <i>will</i> marry me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell the aunt I live with to ask you to dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will you marry me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you wished me to cheat my horoscope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you find a better means of doing so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! if I should marry Louis Leczinski...?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to be sure. You would have it that I was Louis Leczinski. But, on
      that subject, I must warn you seriously&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One instant,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;People must look other people straight in
      the face when they&rsquo;re giving serious warnings. Look straight into my eyes,
      and continue your serious warning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must really warn you seriously,&rdquo; said he, biting his lip, &ldquo;that if you
      persist in that preposterous delusion about my being Louis Leczinski,
      you&rsquo;ll be most awfully sold. I have nothing on earth to do with Louis
      Leczinski. Your ingenious little theories, as I tried to convince you at
      the time, were absolute romance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyebrows raised a little, she kept her eyes fixed steadily on his&mdash;oh,
      in the drollest fashion, with a gaze that seemed to say &ldquo;How admirably you
      do it! I wonder whether you imagine I believe you. Oh, you fibber! Aren&rsquo;t
      you ashamed to tell me such abominable fibs?&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood still, eyeing each other thus, for something like twenty
      seconds, and then they both laughed and walked on.

    <h2>
      P&rsquo;TIT-BLEU
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>&rsquo;tit-Bleu, poor
      P&rsquo;tit-Bleu! I can&rsquo;t name her without a sigh; I can&rsquo;t think of her without
      a kind of heartache. Yet, all things considered, I wonder whether hers was
      really a destiny to sorrow over. True, she has disappeared; and it is not
      pleasant to conjecture what she may have come to, what may have befallen
      her, in the flesh, since her disappearance. But when I remember those
      beautiful preceding years of self-abnegation, of great love, and pain, and
      devotion, I find myself instinctively believing that something good she
      must have permanently gained; some treasure that nothing, not the worst
      imaginable subsequent disaster, can quite have taken from her. It is not
      pleasant to conjecture what she may have done or suffered in the flesh;
      but in the spirit, one may hope, she cannot have gone altogether to the
      bad, nor fared altogether ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the spirit! Dear me, there was a time when it would have seemed
      derisory to speak of the spirit in the same breath with P&rsquo;tit-Bleu. In the
      early days of my acquaintance with her, for example, I should have stared
      if anybody had spoken of her spirit. If anybody had asked me to describe
      her, I should have said, &ldquo;She is a captivating little animal, pretty and
      sprightly, but as soulless&mdash;as soulless as a squirrel.&rdquo; Oh, a
      warm-blooded little animal, good-natured, quick-witted, full of life and
      the joy of life; a delightful little animal to play with, to fondle; but
      just a little animal, none the less: a little mass of soft, rosy, jocund,
      sensual, soulless matter. And in her full red lips, her roguish black
      eyes, her plump little hands, her trim, tight little figure&mdash;in her
      smile, her laugh&mdash;in the toss of her head&mdash;in her saucy,
      slightly swaggering carriage&mdash;I fancy you would have read my
      appreciation justified. No doubt there must have been the spark 01 a soul
      smouldering somewhere in her (how, otherwise, account for what happened
      later on?), but it was far too tiny a spark to be perceptible to the
      casual observer. Soul, however, I need hardly add, was the last thing we
      of the University were accustomed to look for in our feminine companions;
      I must not for an instant seem to imply that the lack of a soul in
      P&rsquo;tit-Bleu was a subject of mourning with any of us. That a Latin Quarter
      girl should be soulless was as much a part of the natural order of
      creation, as that she should be beardless. They were all of them little
      animals, and P&rsquo;tit-Bleu diverged from the type principally in this, that
      where the others, in most instances, were stupid, objectionable little
      animals, she was a diverting one. She was made of sugar and spice and a
      hundred nice ingredients, whilst they were made of the dullest, vulgarest
      clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my own case, P&rsquo;tit-Bleu was the object, not indeed of love, but of a
      violent infatuation, at first sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Bullier, one evening, a chain of students, some twenty linked hand in
      hand, were chasing her round and round the hall, shouting after her, in
      rough staccato, something that sounded like, &ldquo;Ti-<i>bah!</i> Ti-<i>bah</i>!
      Ti-<i>bah</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;while she, a sprite-like little form, in a black
      skirt and a scarlet bodice, fled before them with leaps and bounds, and
      laughed defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hadn&rsquo;t the vaguest notion what &ldquo;Ti-<i>bah</i>! Ti-<i>bah</i>! Ti-<i>bah</i>!&rdquo;
       meant, but that laughing face, with the red lips and the roguish eyes,
      seemed to me immensely fascinating. Among the faces of the other young
      ladies present&mdash;faces of dough, faces of tallow, faces all weariness,
      staleness, and banality, common, coarse, pointless, insipid faces&mdash;it
      shone like an epigram amongst platitudes, a thing of fire amongst things
      of dust. I turned to some one near me, and asked who she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s P&rsquo;tit-Bleu, the dancing girl. She&rsquo;s going to do a quadrille.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      P&rsquo;tit-Bleu.... It&rsquo;s the fashion, you know, in Paris, for the girls who &ldquo;do
      quadrilles&rdquo; to adopt unlikely nicknames: aren&rsquo;t the reigning favourites at
      this moment Chapeau-Mou and Fifi-la-Galette? P&rsquo;tit-Bleu had derived hers
      from that vehement little &ldquo;wine of the barrier,&rdquo; which, the song declares,
      &ldquo;vous met la tête en feu.&rdquo; It was the tune of the same song, that, in
      another minute, I heard the band strike up, in the balcony over our heads.
      P&rsquo;tit-Bleu came to a standstill in the middle of the floor, where she was
      joined by three minor dancing-girls, to make two couples. The chain of
      students closed in a circle round her. And the rest of us thronged behind
      them, pressing forward, and craning our necks. Then, as the band played,
      everybody sang, in noisy chorus:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;P&rsquo;tit-Bleu, P&rsquo;tit-Bleu, P&rsquo;tit-Bleu-eu,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ça vous met la tête en feu!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ça vous ra-ra-ra-ra-ra,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ça vous ra-ra-ravigotte!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      P&rsquo;tit-Bleu stood with her hands on her hips, her arms a-kimbo, her head
      thrown impudently back, her eyes sparkling mischievously, her lips curling
      in a perpetual play of smiles, while her three subalterns accomplished
      their tame preliminary measures; and then P&rsquo;tit-Bleu pirouetted forward,
      and began her own indescribable pas-seul&mdash;oh, indescribable for a
      hundred reasons. She wore scarlet satin slippers, embroidered with black
      beads, and black silk stockings with scarlet clocks, and simply cataracts
      and cataracts of white diaphanous frills under her demure black skirt. And
      she danced with constantly increasing fervour, kicked higher and higher,
      ever more boldly and more bravely. Presently her hat fell off, and she
      tossed it from her, calling to the member of the crowd who had the luck to
      catch it, &ldquo;Tiens mon chapeau!&rdquo; And then her waving black hair flowed down
      her back, and flew loose about her face and shoulders. And the whole time,
      she laughed&mdash;laughed&mdash;laughed. With her swift whirlings, her
      astonishing undulations, and the flashing of the red and black and white,
      one&rsquo;s eyes were dazzled. &ldquo;Ça vous met la tête en feu!&rdquo; My head burned and
      reeled, as I watched her, and I thought, &ldquo;What a delicious, bewitching
      little creature! What wouldn&rsquo;t I give to know her!&rdquo; My head burned, and my
      heart yearned covetously; but I was a new-comer in the Quarter, and
      ignorant of its easy etiquette, and terribly young and timid, and I should
      never have dared to speak to her without a proper introduction. She danced
      with constantly increasing fervour, faster, faster, furiously fast: till,
      suddenly&mdash;<i>zip!</i>&mdash;down she slid upon the floor, in the <i>grand
      écart,</i> and sat there (if one may call that posture sitting), smiling
      calmly up at us, whilst everybody thundered, &ldquo;Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In an instant, though, she was on her feet again, and had darted out of
      the circle to the side of the youth who had caught her hat. He offered it
      to her with a bow, but his pulses were thumping tempestuously, and no
      doubt she could read his envy in his eyes. Anyhow, all at once, she put
      her arm through his, and said&mdash;oh, thrills and wonders!&mdash;&ldquo;Allons,
      mon petit, I authorise you to treat me to a bock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as if impossible heavens had opened to me; yet there she was,
      clinging to my arm, and drawing me towards the platform under the
      musicians&rsquo; gallery, where there are tables for the thirsty. Her little
      plump white hand lay on my coat-sleeve; the air was heady with the perfume
      of her garments; her roguish black eyes were smiling encouragement into
      mine; and her red lips were so near, so near, I had to fight down a wild
      impulse to stoop and snatch a kiss. She drew me towards the tables, and,
      on the way, she stopped before a mirror fixed in the wall, and rearranged
      her hair; while I stood close to her, still holding her hat, and waited,
      feeling the most exquisite proud swelling of the heart, as if I owned her.
      Her hair put right, she searched in her pocket and produced a small round
      ivory box, from which&mdash;having unscrewed its cover and handed it to me
      with a &ldquo;<i>Tiens ça</i>&rdquo;&mdash;she extracted a powder-puff; and therewith
      she proceeded gently, daintily, to dust her face and throat, examining the
      effect critically in the glass the while. In the end she said, &ldquo;<i>Voilà</i>,
      that&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; and turned her face to me for corroboration. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      better, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfect. But&mdash;but you were perfect before,
      too,&rdquo; asseverated I. Oh, what a joy beyond measure thus to be singled out
      and made her confidant and adviser in these intimate affairs.... At our
      table, leaning back nonchalantly in her chair, as she quaffed her bock and
      puffed her cigarette, she looked like a bright-eyed, red-lipped bacchante.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gazed at her in a quite unutterable ecstasy of admiration. My conscience
      told me that I ought to pay her a compliment upon her dancing; but I
      couldn&rsquo;t shape one: my wits were paralysed by my emotions. I could only
      gaze, and gaze, and revel in my unexpected fortune. At last, however, the
      truth burst from me in a sort of involuntary gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are adorable&mdash;adorable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave a quick smile of intelligence, of sympathy, and, with a knowing
      toss of the head and a provoking glance, suggested, &ldquo;Je te mets la tête en
      feu, quoi!&rdquo; She, you perceive, was entirely at her ease, mistress of the
      situation. It is conceivable that she had met neophytes before&mdash;that
      I was by no means to her the unprecedented experience she was to me. At
      any rate, she understood my agitation and sought to reassure me. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be
      afraid; I&rsquo;ll not eat you,&rdquo; she promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      I, in the depths of my mind, had been meditating what I could not but deem
      an excessively audacious proposal Her last speech gave me my cue, and I
      risked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you would like to eat something else? If&mdash;if we should go
      somewhere and sup?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur thinks he will be safer to take precautions,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;Well&mdash;I
      submit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we removed ourselves to the cloak-room, where she put on her cloak, and
      exchanged her slippers for a pair of boots (you can guess, perhaps, who
      enjoyed the beatific privilege of buttoning them for her); and then we
      left the Closerie des Lilas, falsely so called, with its flaring gas, its
      stifling atmosphere, its boisterous merrymakers, and walked arm in arm&mdash;only
      this time it was <i>my</i> arm that was within <i>hers</i>&mdash;down the
      Boul&rsquo; Miche, past the Luxembourg gardens, where sweet airs blew in our
      faces, to the Gambrinus restaurant, in the Rue de Médicis. And there you
      should have seen P&rsquo;tit-Bleu devouring écrevisses. Whatsoever this young
      woman&rsquo;s hand found to do, she did it with her might. She attacked her
      écrevisses with the same jubilant abandon with which she had executed her
      bewildering single-step. She devoured them with an energy, an enthusiasm,
      a thoroughness, that it was invigorating to witness; smacking her lips,
      and smiling, and, from time to time, between the mouthfuls, breathing soft
      little interjections of content. When the last pink shell was emptied, she
      threw herself back, and sighed, and explained, with delectable
      unconsciousness, &ldquo;I was hungry.&rdquo; But at my venturing to protest, &ldquo;Not
      really?&rdquo; she broke into mirthful laughter, and added, &ldquo;At least, I had the
      appearance.&rdquo; Meanwhile, I must not fail to mention, she had done abundant
      honour to her share of a bottle of chablis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don&rsquo;t be horrified&mdash;haven&rsquo;t the Germans, who ought to know, a proverb
      that recommends it? &ldquo;Wein auf Bier, das rath&rsquo; ich Dir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have said that none of us mourned the absence of a soul in P&rsquo;tit-Bleu.
      Nevertheless, as I looked at her to-night, and realised what a bright,
      joyous, good-humoured little thing she was, how healthy, and natural, and
      even, in a way, innocent she was, I suddenly felt a curious depression.
      She was all this, and yet... For just a moment, perhaps, I did vaguely
      mourn the lack of something. Oh, she was well enough for the present; she
      was joyous, and good-humoured, and innocent in a way; she was young and
      pretty, and the world smiled upon her. But&mdash;for the future? When it
      occurred to me to think of her future&mdash;of what it must almost
      certainly be like, of what she must almost inevitably become&mdash;I
      confess my jaw dropped, and the salt of our banquet lost its savour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Why do you look at me like that?&rdquo; P&rsquo;tit-Bleu demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I had to pull myself up and be jolly again. It was not altogether
      difficult. In the early twenties, troublesome reflections are easily
      banished, I believe; and I had a lively comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      After her crayfish were disposed of, P&rsquo;tit-Bleu called for coffee and lit
      a cigarette. And then, between whiffs and sips, she prattled gaily of the
      subject which, of all subjects, she was probably best qualified to treat,
      and which assuredly, for the time being, possessed most interest for her
      listener&mdash;P&rsquo;tit-Bleu. She told me, as it were, the story of her
      birth, parentage, life, and exploits. It was the simplest story, the
      commonest story. Her mother (<i>la recherche de la paternité est interdite</i>),
      her mother had died when she was sixteen, and Jeanne (that was her
      baptismal name, Jeanne Mérois) had gone to work in the shop of a
      dressmaker, where, sewing hard from eight in the morning till seven at
      night, with an hour&rsquo;s intermission at noon, she could earn, in good
      seasons, as much as two-francs-fifty a day. Two and a half francs a day&mdash;say
      twelve shillings a week&mdash;in good seasons; and one must eat, and
      lodge, and clothe one&rsquo;s body, and pay one&rsquo;s laundress, in good seasons and
      in bad. It scarcely satisfied her aspirations, and she took to dancing.
      Now she danced three nights a week at Bullier, and during the day gave
      lessons in her art to a score of pupils, by which means she contrived to
      keep the wolf at a respectful distance from her door. &ldquo;Tiens, here&rsquo;s my
      card,&rdquo; she concluded, and handed me an oblong bit of pasteboard, on which
      was printed, &ldquo;P&rsquo;tit-Bleu, Professeur de Danse, 22, Rue Monsieur le
      Prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have no lover?&rdquo; questioned I.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flashed a look upon me that was quite inexpressibly arch, and
      responded instantly, with the charmingest little pout, &ldquo;But yes&mdash;since
      I&rsquo;m supping with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During the winter that followed, P&rsquo;tit-Bleu and I supped together somewhat
      frequently. She was a mere little animal, she had no soul; but she was the
      nicest little animal, and she had instincts. She was more than
      good-natured, she was kind-hearted; and, according to her unconventional
      standards, she was conscientious. It would have amused and touched you,
      for example, if you had been taking her about, to notice her intense
      solicitude lest you should conduct her entertainment upon a scale too
      lavish, her deprecating frowns, her expostulations, her restraining hand
      laid on your arm. And the ordinary run of Latin Quarter girls derive an
      incommunicable rapture from seeing their cavaliers wantonly, purposelessly
      prodigal. With her own funds, on the contrary, P&rsquo;tit-Bleu was free-handed
      to a fault: Mimi and Zizette knew whom to go to, when they were hard-up.
      Neither did she confine her benefactions to gifts of money, nor limit
      their operation to her particular sex. More than one impecunious student
      owed it to her skilful needle that his clothes were whole, and his linen
      maintained in a habitable state. &ldquo;Fie, Chalks! Your coat is torn, there
      are three buttons off your waistcoat, and your cuffs are frayed to a point
      that is disgraceful. I&rsquo;ll come round to-morrow afternoon, and mend them
      for you.&rdquo; And when poor Berthe Dumours was turned out of the hospital, in
      the dead of winter, half-cured, and without a penny in her purse, who took
      her in, and nursed her, and provided for her during her convalescence?
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, she was a good little thing. &ldquo;P&rsquo;tit-Bleu&rsquo;s all right. There&rsquo;s nothing
      the matter with P&rsquo;tit-Bleu,&rdquo; was Chalks&rsquo;s method of phrasing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, she could be trying, she could be exasperating. And she
      had a temper&mdash;a temper. What she made me suffer in the way of
      jealousy, during that winter, it would be gruesome to recount. She enjoyed
      an exceeding great popularity in the Quarter; she was much run after. It
      were futile to pretend that she hadn&rsquo;t her caprices. And she held herself
      free as air. She would call no man master.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might take what she would give, and welcome; but you must claim
      nothing as your due. You mustn&rsquo;t presume upon the fact that she was
      supping with you to-night, to complain if she should sup tomorrow with
      another. Her concession of a privilege did not by any means imply that it
      was exclusive. She would endure no exactions, no control or interference,
      no surveillance, above all, no reproaches. Mercy, how angry she would
      become if I ventured any, how hoighty-toighty and unapproachable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You imagine that I am your property? Did you invent me? One would say you
      held a Government patent. All rights reserved! Thank you. You fancy
      perhaps that Paris is Constantinople? Ah, mais non!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had a temper and a flow of language. There were points you couldn&rsquo;t
      touch without precipitating hail and lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus my winter was far from a tranquil one, and before it was half over I
      had three grey hairs. Honey and wormwood, happiness and heartburn,
      reconciliations and frantic little tiffs, carried us blithely on to
      Mi-Carême, when things reached a crisis....
    </p>
    <p>
      Mi-Carême fell midway in March that year: a velvety, sweet, sunlit day,
      Spring stirring in her sleep. P&rsquo;tit-Bleu and I had spent the day together,
      in the crowded, crowded streets. We had visited the Boulevards, of course,
      to watch the triumph of the Queen of Washerwomen; we had pelted everybody
      with confetti; and we had been pelted so profusely in return, that there
      were confetti in our boots, in our pockets, down our necks, and numberless
      confetti clung in the black meshes of P&rsquo;tit-Bleu&rsquo;s hair, like little pink,
      blue, and yellow stars. But all day long something in P&rsquo;tit-Bleu&rsquo;s manner,
      something in her voice, her smile, her carriage, had obscurely troubled
      me; something not easy to take hold of, something elusive, unformulable,
      but disquieting. A certain indefinite aloofness, perhaps; an accentuated
      independence; as if she were preoccupied with secret thoughts, with
      intentions, feelings, that she would not let me share.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, at night, we went to the Opera Ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      P&rsquo;tit-Bleu was dressed as an Odalisque: a tiny round Turkish cap set
      jauntily sidewise on her head, a short Turkish jacket, both coat and
      jacket jingling and glittering with sequins; a long veil of gauze,
      wreathed like a scarf round her shoulders; then baggy Turkish trousers of
      blue silk, and scarlet Turkish slippers. Oh, she was worth seeing; I was
      proud to have her on my arm. Her black crinkling hair, her dancing eyes,
      her eager face and red smiling mouth&mdash;the Sultan himself might have
      envied me such a houri. And many, in effect, were the envious glances that
      we encountered, as we made our way into the great brilliantly lighted
      ball-room, and moved hither and thither among the Harlequins and
      Columbines, the Pierrots, the Toréadors, the Shepherdesses and
      Vivandières, the countless fantastic masks, by whom the place was peopled.
      P&rsquo;tit-Bleu had a <i>loup</i> of black velvet, which sometimes she wore,
      and sometimes gave to me to carry for her. I don&rsquo;t know when she looked
      the more dangerous, when she had it on, and her eyes glimmered
      mysteriously through its peepholes, or when she had it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many were the envious glances that we encountered, and presently I became
      aware that one individual was following us about: a horrid, glossy
      creature, in a dress suit, with a top-hat that was much too shiny, and a
      hugh waxed moustache that he kept twirling invidiously: an undersized,
      dark, Hebraic-featured man, screamingly &ldquo;rasta&rsquo;.&rdquo; Whithersoever we turned,
      he hovered annoyingly near to us, and ogled P&rsquo;tit-Bleu under my very
      beard. This was bad enough; but&mdash;do sorrows ever come as single
      spies?&mdash;conceive my emotions, if you please, when, by-and-by,
      suspicion hardened into certitude that P&rsquo;tit-Bleu was not merely getting a
      vainglorious gratification from his attentions, but that she was
      positively playing up to them, encouraging him to persevere! She chattered&mdash;to
      me, indeed, but at him&mdash;with a vivacity there was no misconstruing;
      laughed noisily, fluttered her fan, flirted her veil, donned and doffed
      her loup, and, I daresay, when my back was turned, exchanged actual
      eye-shots with the brute.... In due time quadrilles were organised, and
      P&rsquo;tit-Bleu led a set. The glossy interloper was one of the admiring circle
      that surrounded her. Ugh! his complacent, insinuating smile, the
      conquering air with which he twirled his moustachios. And P&rsquo;tit-Bleu....
      When, at the finish, she sprang up, after her <i>grand écart</i>, what do
      you suppose she did?... The brazen little minx, instead of rejoining <i>me</i>,
      slipped her arm through <i>his</i>, and went tripping off with him to the
      supper-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, the night I passed, the night of anguish! The visions that tortured
      me, as I tramped my floor! The delirious revenges that I plotted, and
      gloated over in anticipation! She had left me&mdash;the mockery of it!&mdash;she
      had left me her loup, her little black velvet loup, with its empty
      eye-holes, and its horribly reminiscent smell. Everything P&rsquo;tit-Bleu owned
      was scented with peau-d&rsquo;.spagne. I wreaked my fury upon that loup, I
      promise you. I smote it with my palm, I ground it under my heel, I tore it
      limb from limb, I called it all manner of abusive names. Early in the
      morning I was at P&rsquo;tit-Bleu&rsquo;s house; but the concierge grunted, &ldquo;Pas
      rentrée.&rdquo; Oh, the coals thereof are coals of fire. I returned to her house
      a dozen times that day, and at length, towards nightfall, found her in. We
      had a stormy session, but, of course, the last word of it was hers: still,
      for all slips, she was one of Eve&rsquo;s family. Of course she justified
      herself, and put me in the wrong. I went away, vowing I would never,
      never, never see her again. &ldquo;Va! Ça m&rsquo;est bien égal,&rdquo; she capped the
      climax by calling after me. Oh, youth! Oh, storm and stress! And to think
      that one lives to laugh at its memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest of that season, P&rsquo;tit-Bleu and I remained at daggers drawn.
      In June I left town for the summer; and then one thing and another
      happened, and kept me away till after Christmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got back, amongst the many pieces of news that I found waiting for
      me, there was one that affected P&rsquo;tit-Bleu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P&rsquo;tit-Bleu,&rdquo; I was told, &ldquo;is &rsquo;collée&rsquo; with an Englishman&mdash;but a
      grey-beard, mon cher&mdash;a gaga&mdash;an Englishman old enough to be her
      grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A stolid, implicit cynicism, I must warn you, was the mode of the Quarter.
      The student who did not wish to be contemned for a sentimentalist, dared
      never hesitate to believe an evil report, nor to put the worst possible
      construction upon all human actions. Therefore, when I was apprised by
      common rumour that during the dead season P&rsquo;tit-Bleu (for considerations
      fiscal, <i>bien entendu</i>) had gone to live &ldquo;collée&rdquo; with an Englishman
      old enough to be her grandfather&mdash;though, as it turned out, the story
      was the sheerest fabrication&mdash;it never entered my head to doubt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, I confess, I could not quite share the humour of my
      compeers, who regarded the circumstance as a stupendous joke. On the
      contrary, I was shocked and sickened. I shouldn&rsquo;t have imagined her
      capable of that. She was a mere little animal; she had no soul; she was
      bound, in the nature of things, to go from bad to worse, as I had
      permitted myself, indeed, to admonish her, in the last conversation we had
      had. &ldquo;Mark my words, you will go from bad to worse.&rdquo; But I had thought her
      such a nice little animal; in my secret heart, I had hoped that her
      progress would be slow&mdash;even, faintly, that Providence might let
      something happen to arrest it, to divert it. And now....!
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, Providence <i>had</i> let something happen to divert
      it; and that something was this very relation of hers with an old
      Englishman, in which the scandal-lovers of the Latin Quarter were
      determined to see neither more nor less than a mercenary &ldquo;collage.&rdquo; The
      diversion in question, however, was an extremely gradual process. As yet,
      it is pretty certain, P&rsquo;tit-Bleu herself had never so much as dreamed that
      any diversion was impending.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she knew that her relation with the Englishman was an innocent
      relation; and of its innocence, I am glad to be able to record, she
      succeeded in convincing one, at least, of her friends, tolerably early in
      the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the teeth of my opposition, and at the expense of her own pride, she
      forced an explanation, which, I am glad to say, convinced me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had just passed her and her Englishman in the street. They were crossing
      the Boulevard St. Michel, and she was hanging on his arm, looking up into
      his face, and laughing. She wore a broad-brimmed black hat, with a red
      ribbon in it, and a knot of red ribbon at her throat; there was a lovely
      suggestion of the same colour in her cheeks; and never had her eyes
      gleamed with sincerer fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      I assure you, the sensation this spectacle afforded me amounted to a
      physical pain&mdash;the disgust, the anger. If she could laugh like that,
      how little could she feel her position! The hardened shamelessness of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning from her to her companion, I own I was surprised and puzzled. He
      was a tall, spare old man, not a grey-beard, but a white-beard, and he had
      thin snow-white hair. He was dressed neatly indeed, but the very reverse
      of sumptuously. His black overcoat was threadbare, his carefully polished
      boots were patched. Yet, everybody averred, it was his affluence that had
      attracted her; she had taken up with him during the dead season, because
      she had been &ldquo;à sec.&rdquo; A detail that did nothing to relieve my perplexity
      was the character of his face. Instead of the florid concupiscent face,
      with coarse lips and fiery eye-balls, I had instinctively expected, I saw
      a thin, pale face, with mild, melancholy eyes, a gentle face, a refined
      face, rather a weak face, certainly the very last face the situation
      called for. He <i>was</i> a beast, of course, but he didn&rsquo;t look like a
      beast. He looked like a gentleman, a broken-down, forlorn old gentleman,
      singularly astray from his proper orbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were crossing the Boulevard St. Michel as I was leaving the Café
      Vachette; and at the corner of the Rue des Ecoles we came front to front.
      P&rsquo;tit-Bleu glanced up; her eyes brightened, she gave a little start, and
      was plainly for stopping to shake hands. I cut her dead....
    </p>
    <p>
      I cut her dead, and held my course serenely down the Boulevard&mdash;though
      I&rsquo;m not sure my heart wasn&rsquo;t pounding. But I could lay as unction to my
      soul the consciousness of having done the appropriate thing, of having
      marked my righteous indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a minute, however, I heard the pat-pat of rapid footsteps on the
      pavement behind me, and my name being called. I hurried on, careful not to
      turn my head. But, at Cluny, P&rsquo;tit-Bleu arrived abreast of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to speak to you,&rdquo; she gasped, out of breath from running.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shrugged my shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you tell me why you cut me like that just now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t know, I doubt if I could make you understand,&rdquo; I answered,
      with an air of, imperial disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bear me a grudge, hein? For what I did last March? Well, then, you
      are right. There. I was abominable. But I have been sorry, and I ask your
      pardon. Now will you let bygones be bygones? Will you forgive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t try to play the simpleton with me. You are perfectly
      well aware that isn&rsquo;t why I cut you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why, then?&rdquo; cried she, admirably counterfeiting (as I took for
      granted) a look and accent of bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked on without speaking. She kept beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why, then? If it isn&rsquo;t that, what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I insist upon your telling me. Tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, then. I don&rsquo;t care to know a girl who lives &rsquo;collée&rsquo; with a
      gaga,&rdquo; I said, brutally.
    </p>
    <p>
      P&rsquo;tit-Bleu flushed suddenly, and faced me with blazing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comment done! You believe that?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mais non, mais non, mais non, alors! You don&rsquo;t believe that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You pay me a poor compliment. Why should you expect me to be ignorant of
      a thing the whole Quarter knows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the whole Quarter! What does that matter to me, your Quarter? Those
      nasty little students! C&rsquo;est de la crasse, quoi! They may believe&mdash;they
      may say&mdash;what they like. Oh, ça m&rsquo;est bien égal!&rdquo; with a shake of the
      head and a skyward gesture. &ldquo;But you&mdash;but my friends! Am I that sort
      of girl? Answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one sort of girl in the precincts ot this University,&rdquo;
       declared her disenchanted interlocutor. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all of one pattern. The
      man&rsquo;s an ass who expects any good from any of you. Don&rsquo;t pose as better
      than the others. You&rsquo;re all a&mdash;un tas de saletés. I&rsquo;m sick and tired
      of the whole sordid, squalid lot of you. I should be greatly obliged, now,
      if you would have the kindness to leave me. Go back to your gaga. He&rsquo;ll be
      impatient waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That speech, I fancied, would rid me of her. But no.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are trying to make me angry, aren&rsquo;t you? But I refuse to leave you
      till you have admitted that you are wrong,&rdquo; she persisted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an
      outrageous slander. Monsieur Long (that is his name, Monsieur Long), he
      lives in the same house with me, on the same landing; et voilà tout. Dame!
      Can I prevent him? Am I the landlord? And, for that, they say I&rsquo;m &rsquo;collée&rsquo;
      with him. I don&rsquo;t care what they say. But you! I swear to you it is an
      infamous lie. Will you come home with me now, and see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s mere quibbling. You go with him everywhere, you dine with him,
      you are never seen without him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dieu de Dieu!&rdquo; wailed P&rsquo;tit-Bleu. &ldquo;How shall I convince you? He is my
      neighbour. Is it forbidden to know one&rsquo;s neighbours? I swear to you, I
      give you my word of honour, it is nothing else. How to make you believe
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if you wish me to believe you, break with him.
      Chuck him up. Drop his acquaintance. Nobody in his senses will believe you
      so long as you go trapesing about the Quarter with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but no,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t drop his acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, there it is,&rdquo; cried I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are reasons. There are reasons why I can&rsquo;t, why I mustn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, voyons!&rdquo; she broke out, losing patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not believe my word of honour? Will you force me to tell you
      things that don&rsquo;t concern you&mdash;that I have no right to tell? Well,
      then, listen. I cannot drop his acquaintance, because&mdash;this is a
      secret&mdash;he would die of shame if he thought I had betrayed it&mdash;you
      will never breathe it to a soul&mdash;because I have discovered that he
      has a&mdash;a vice, a weakness. No&mdash;but listen. He is an Englishman,
      a painter. Oh, a painter of great talent; a painter who has exposed at the
      Salon&mdash;quoi! A painter who is known in his country. On a même parlé
      de lui dans les journaux; voilà! But look. He has a vice. He has half
      ruined, half killed himself with a drug. Yes&mdash;opium. Oh, but wait,
      wait. I will tell you. He came to live in our house last July, in the room
      opposite mine. When we met, on the landing, in the staircase, he took off
      his hat, and we passed the bonjour. Oh, he is a gentleman; he has been
      well brought up. From that we arrived at speaking together a little, and
      then at visiting. It was the dead season, I had no affairs. I would sit in
      his room in the afternoon, and we would chat. Oh, he is a fine talker.
      But, though he had canvases, colours, all that is needed for painting, he
      never painted. He would only talk, talk. I said, &rsquo;But you ought to paint.&rsquo;
      He said always, &rsquo;Yes, I must begin something to-morrow.&rsquo; Always to-morrow.
      And then I discovered what it was. He took opium. He spent all his money
      for opium. And when he had taken his opium he would not work, he would
      only talk, talk, talk, and then sleep, sleep. You think that is well&mdash;hein?
      That a painter of talent should do no work, but spend all his money for a
      drug, for a poison, and then say, &rsquo;To-morrow&rsquo;. You think I could sit still
      and see him commit these follies under my eyes and say nothing, do
      nothing? Ruin his brain, his health, his career, and waste all his money,
      for that drug? Oh, mais non. I made him the sermon. I said, &rsquo;You know it
      is very bad, that which you are doing there.&rsquo; I scolded him. I said, &rsquo;But
      I forbid you to do that&mdash;do you understand? I forbid it.&rsquo; I went with
      him everywhere, I gave him all my time; and when he would take his drug I
      would annoy him, I would make a scene, I would shame him. Well, in the
      end, I have acquired an influence over him. He has submitted himself to
      me. He is really trying to break the habit. I keep all his money. I give
      him his doses. I regulate them, I diminish them. The consequence is, I
      make him work. I give him one very small dose in the morning to begin the
      day. Then I will give him no more till he has done so much work. You see?
      Tu te figures que je suis sa maîtresse? Je suis plutôt sa nounou&mdash;va!
      Je suis sa caissière. And he is painting a great picture&mdash;you will
      see. Eh bien, how can I give up his acquaintance? Can I let him relapse,
      as he would do to-morrow without me, into his bad habit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was walking with long strides, P&rsquo;tit-Bleu tripping at my elbow; and
      before her story was finished we had left the Boulevard behind us, and
      reached the middle of the Pont St. Michel. There, I don&rsquo;t know why, we
      halted, and stood looking off towards Notre-Dame. The grim grey front of
      the Cathedral glowed softly amethystine in the afternoon sun, and the sky
      was infinitely deep and blue above it. One could be intensely conscious of
      the splendid penetrating beauty of this picture, without, somehow, giving
      the less attention to what P&rsquo;tit-Bleu was saying. She talked swiftly,
      eagerly, with constantly changing, persuasive intonations, with little
      brief pauses, hesitations, with many gestures, with much play of eyes and
      face. When she had done, I waited a moment. Then, grudgingly, &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I
      began, &ldquo;if what you tell me is true&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>If</i> it is true!&rdquo; P&rsquo;tit-Bleu cried, with sudden fierceness. &ldquo;Do you
      dare to say you doubt it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she gazed intently, fiercely, into my eyes, challenging me, as it
      were, to give her the lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before that gaze my eyes dropped, abashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I don&rsquo;t doubt it,&rdquo; I faltered, &ldquo;I believe you. And&mdash;and
      allow me to say that you are a&mdash;a damned decent little girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor P&rsquo;tit-Bleu! How shall I tell you the rest of her story&mdash;the
      story of those long years of love and sacrifice and devotion, and of
      continual discouragement, disappointment, with his death at the end of
      them, and her disappearance?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the beginning she herself was very far from realising what she had
      undertaken, what had befallen her. To exercise a little friendly
      supervision over her neighbour&rsquo;s addiction to opium, to husband his money
      for him, and spur him on to work&mdash;it seemed a mere incident in her
      life, an affair by the way. But it became her exclusive occupation, her
      whole life&rsquo;s chief concern. Little by little, one after the other, she put
      aside all her former interests, thoughts, associations, dropped all her
      former engagements, to give herself as completely to caring for, guarding,
      guiding poor old Edward Long, as if she had been a mother, and he her
      helpless child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout that first winter, indeed, she continued to dance at Bullier,
      continued to instruct her corps of pupils, and continued even
      occasionally, though much less frequently than of old time, to be seen at
      the Vachette, or to sup with a friend at the Gambrinus. But from day to
      day Monsieur Edouard (he had soon ceased to be Monsieur Long, and become
      Monsieur Edouard) absorbed more and more of her time and attention; and
      when the spring came she suddenly burned her ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must understand that she had one pertinacious adversary in her efforts
      to wean him of his vice. Not an avowed adversary, for he professed the
      most earnest wish that she might be successful; but an adversary who was
      eternally putting spokes in her wheel, all the same. Yes, Monsieur Edouard
      himself. Never content with the short rations to which she had condemned
      him, he was perpetually on the watch for a chance to elude her vigilance;
      she was perpetually discovering that he had somehow contrived to lay in
      secret supplies. And every now and again, openly defying her authority, he
      would go off for a grand debauch. Then her task of reducing his daily
      portion to a minimum must needs be begun anew. Well, when the spring came,
      and the Salon opened, where his picture (<i>her</i> picture?) had been
      received and very fairly hung, they went together to the Vernissage. And
      there he met a whole flock of English folk&mdash;artists and critics, who
      had &ldquo;just run over for the show, you know&rdquo;&mdash;with whom he was
      acquainted; and they insisted on carrying him away with them to lunch at
      the Ambassadeurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I, too, had assisted at the Vernissage; and when I left it, I found
      P&rsquo;tit-Bleu seated alone under the trees in the Champs-Elysées. She had on
      a brilliant spring toilette, with a hat and a sunshade.... Oh, my dear! It
      is not to be denied that P&rsquo;tit-Bleu had the courage of her tastes. But her
      face was pale, and her lips were drawn down, and her eyes looked strained
      and anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the row?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she told me how she had been abandoned&mdash;&ldquo;plantée là&rdquo; was her
      expression&mdash;and of course I invited her to lunch with me. But she
      scarcely relished the repast. &ldquo;Pourvu qu&rsquo;il ne fasse pas de bêtises!&rdquo; was
      her refrain.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned rather early to the Rue Monsieur le Prince, to see if he had
      come home; but he hadn&rsquo;t. Nor did he come home that night, nor the next
      day, nor the next. At the week&rsquo;s end, though, he came: dirty, haggard,
      tremulous, with red eyes, and nude&mdash;yes, nude&mdash;of everything
      save his shirt and trousers! He had borrowed a sovereign from one of his
      London friends, and when that was gone, he had pledged or sold everything
      but his shirt and trousers&mdash;hat, boots, coat, everything. It was an
      equally haggard and red-eyed P&rsquo;tit-Bleu who faced him on his reappearance.
      And I&rsquo;ve no doubt she gave him a specimen of her eloquence. &ldquo;You figure to
      yourself that this sort of thing amuses me, hein? Here are six good days
      and nights that I haven&rsquo;t been able to sleep or rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Explaining the case to me, she said, &ldquo;Ah, what I suffered! I could never
      have believed that I cared so much for him. But&mdash;what would you?&mdash;one
      attaches oneself, you know. Ah, what I suffered! The anxiety, the terrors!
      I expected to hear of him run over in the streets. Well, now, I must make
      an end of this business. I&rsquo;m going to take him away. So long as he remains
      in Paris, where there are chemists who will sell him that filthiness
      (cette crasse) it is hopeless. No sooner do I get my house of cards nicely
      built up, than&mdash;piff!&mdash;something happens to knock it over. I am
      going to take him down into the country, far from any town, far from the
      railway, where I can guard him better. I know a place, a farmhouse, near
      Villiers-St.-Jacques, where we can get board. He has a little income,
      which reaches him every three months from England. Oh, very little, but if
      I am careful of it, it will pay our way. And then&mdash;I will make him
      work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; I protested. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to leave the Quarter.&rdquo; And I&rsquo;m
      ashamed to acknowledge, I laboured hard to dissuade her. &ldquo;Think how we&rsquo;ll
      miss you. Think how you&rsquo;ll bore yourself. And anyhow, he&rsquo;s not worth it.
      And besides, you won&rsquo;t succeed. A man who has an appetite for opium will
      get it, coûte que coûte. He&rsquo;d walk twenty miles in bare feet to get it.&rdquo;
       This was the argument that I repeated in a dozen different paraphrases.
      You see, I hadn&rsquo;t realised yet that it didn&rsquo;t matter an atom whether she
      succeeded, or whether he was worth it. He was a mere instrument in the
      hands of Providence. Let her succeed or let her fail in keeping him from
      opium: the important thing... how shall I put it? This little Undine had
      risen out of the black waters of the Latin Quarter, and attached herself
      to a mortal. What is it that love gains for Undines?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Que veux-tu?&rdquo; cried P&rsquo;tit-Bleu. &ldquo;I am fond of him. I can&rsquo;t bear to see
      him ruining himself. I must do what I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the Quarter said, &ldquo;Ho-ho! You chaps who didn&rsquo;t believe it was a
      &rsquo;collage&rsquo;. He-he! What do you say now? She&rsquo;s chucked up everything, to go
      and live in the country with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In August or September I ran down to the farmhouse near
      Villiers-St.-Jacques, and passed a week with them. I found a mightily
      changed Monsieur Edouard, and a curiously changed P&rsquo;tit-Bleu, as well. He
      was fat and rosy, he who had been so thin and white. And she&mdash;she was
      <i>grave</i>. Yes, P&rsquo;tit-Bleu was grave: sober, staid, serious. And her
      impish, mocking black eyes shone with a strange, serious, calm light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Edouard (with whom my relations had long before this become
      confidential) drew me apart, and told me he was having an exceedingly bad
      time of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s really too absurd, you know. She&rsquo;s a martinet, a tyrant. Opium is
      to me what tobacco is to you, and does me no more harm. I need it for my
      work. Oh, in moderation; of course one can be excessive. Yet she refuses
      to let me have a tenth of my proper quantity. And besides, how utterly
      senseless it is, keeping me down here in the country. I&rsquo;m dying of ennui.
      There&rsquo;s not a person I can have any sort of intellectual sympathy with,
      for miles in every direction. An artist needs the stimulus of contact with
      his fellows. It&rsquo;s indispensable. If she&rsquo;d only let me run up to Paris for
      a day or two at a time, once a month say. Couldn&rsquo;t you persuade her to let
      me go back with you? She&rsquo;s the most awful screw, you know. It&rsquo;s the French
      lower-middle-class parsimony. I&rsquo;m never allowed to have twopence in my
      pocket. Yet whose money is it? Where does it come from? I really can&rsquo;t
      think why I submit, why I don&rsquo;t break away from her, and follow my own
      wishes. But the poor little thing is fond of me; she attached herself to
      me. I don&rsquo;t know what would become of her if I cast her off. Oh, don&rsquo;t
      fancy that I don&rsquo;t appreciate her. Her intentions are excellent. But she
      lacks wisdom, and she enjoys the exercise of power. I wish you&rsquo;d speak
      with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      P&rsquo;tit-Bleu also drew me apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t call me P&rsquo;tit-Bleu any more. Call me Jeanne. I have put all
      that behind me&mdash;all that P&rsquo;tit-Bleu signifies. I hate to think of it,
      to be reminded of it. I should like to forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I had promised not to call her P&rsquo;tit-Bleu any more, she went on,
      replying to my questions, to tell me of their life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, everybody thinks I am his mistress. You can&rsquo;t convince them
      I&rsquo;m not. But that&rsquo;s got to be endured. For the rest, all is going well.
      You see how he is improved. I give him fifteen drops of laudanum, morning,
      noon, and night. Fifteen drops&mdash;it is nothing, I could take it
      myself, and never know it. And he used to drink off an ounce&mdash;an
      ounce, mon cher&mdash;at a time, and then want more at the end of an hour.
      Yes! Oh, he complains, he complains of everything, he frets, he is not
      contented. But he has not walked twenty miles in bare feet, as you said he
      would. And he is working. You will see his pictures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&mdash;how do you pass your time? What do you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pose for him a good deal. And then I have much sewing to do. I take in
      sewing for Madame Deschamps, the Deputy&rsquo;s wife, to help make the ends
      meet. And then I read. Madame Deschamps lends me books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I suppose you&rsquo;re bored to death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I am not bored. I am happy. I never was really happy&mdash;dans
      le temps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were living in a very plain way indeed. You know what French
      farmhouses are apt to be. His whole income was under a hundred pounds a
      year; and out of that (and the trifle she earned by needlework) his
      canvases, colours, brushes, frames, had to be paid for, as well as his
      opium, and their food, clothing, everything. But P&rsquo;tit-Bleu&mdash;Jeanne&mdash;with
      that &ldquo;lower-middle-class parsimony&rdquo; of hers, managed somehow. Jeanne! In
      putting off the name, she had put off also, in great measure, the
      attributes of P&rsquo;tit-Bleu; she had become Jeanne in nature. She was grave,
      she was quiet. She wore the severest black frocks&mdash;she made them
      herself. And I never once noticed the odour of peau-d&rsquo;.spagne, from the
      beginning to the end of my visit. But&mdash;shall I own it? Jeanne was
      certainly the more estimable of the two women, but shall I own that I
      found her far less exciting as a comrade than P&rsquo;tit-Bleu had been? She was
      good, but she wasn&rsquo;t very lively or very amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      P&rsquo;tit-Bleu, the heroine of Bullier, that lover of noisy pleasure, of
      daring toilettes, of risky perfumes, of écrevisses and chablis, of all the
      rush and dissipation of the Boul&rsquo; Miche and the Luxembourg, quietly
      settling down into Jeanne of the home-made frocks, in a rough French
      farmhouse, to a diet of veal and lentils, lentils and veal, seven times a
      week, and no other pastime in life than the devoted, untiring nursing of
      an ungrateful old English opium-eater&mdash;here was variation under
      domestication with a vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And on Sunday... P&rsquo;tit-Bleu went twice to church!
    </p>
    <p>
      About ten days after my return to Paris, there came a rat-ta-ta-tat at my
      door, and P&rsquo;tit-BIeu walked in&mdash;pale, with wide eyes. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
      how he has contrived it, but he must have got some money somewhere, and
      walked to the railway, and come to town. Anyhow, here are three days that
      he has disappeared. What to do? What to do?&rdquo; She was in a deplorable state
      of mind, poor thing, and I scarcely knew how to help her. I proposed that
      we should take counsel with a Commissary of Police. But when that
      functionary discovered that she was neither the wife nor daughter of the
      missing man, he smiled, and remarked, &ldquo;It is not our business to recover
      ladies&rsquo; protectors for them.&rdquo; P&rsquo;tit-BIeu walked the streets in quest of
      him, all day long and very nearly all night long too, for close upon a
      fortnight. In the end, she met him on the quays&mdash;dazed,
      half-imbecile, and again nude of everything save his shirt and trousers.
      So, again, having nicely built up her house of cards&mdash;piff!&mdash;something
      had happened to topple it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him go to the devil his own way,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Really, he&rsquo;s unworthy of
      your pains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t leave him. You see, I&rsquo;m fond of him,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, however, positively refused to return to the country. &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo;
       he explained, &ldquo;I ought to go to London. Yes, it will be well for me to
      pass the winter in London. I should like to have a show there, a one-man
      show, you know. I dare say I could sell a good many pictures, and get
      orders for portraits.&rdquo; So they went to London. In the spring I received a
      letter from P&rsquo;tit-Bleu&mdash;a letter full of orthographic faults, if you
      like&mdash;but a letter that I treasure. Here&rsquo;s a translation of it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Friend,&mdash;I have hesitated much before taking my pen in hand
      to write to you. But I have no one else to turn to. We have had a dreadful
      winter. Owing to my ignorance of the language one speaks in this dirty
      town, I have not been able to exercise over Monsieur Edouard that
      supervision of which he has need. In consequence, he has given himself up
      to the evil habit which you know, as never before. Every penny, every last
      sou, which he could command, has been spent for that detestable filth.
      Many times we have passed whole days without eating, no, not the end of a
      crust. He has no desire to eat when he has had his dose. We are living in
      a slum of the most disgusting, in the quarter of London they call Soho.
      Everything we have, save the bare necessary of covering, has been put with
      the lender-on-pledges. Yesterday I found a piece of one shilling in the
      street. That, however, I have been forced to dispense for opium, because,
      when he has had such large quantities, he would die or go mad if suddenly
      deprived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have addressed myself to his family, but without effect. They refuse to
      recognise me. Everybody here, of course, figures to himself that I am his
      mistress. He has two brothers, one of the army, one an advocate. I have
      besieged them in vain. They say, &rsquo;We have done for him all that is
      possible. We can do no more. He has exhausted our patience. Now that he
      has gone a step farther, and, in his age, disgraced himself by living with
      a mistress, as well as besotting himself with opium, we wash our hands of
      him for good.&rsquo; And yet, I cannot leave him, because I know, without me, he
      would kill himself within the month, by his excesses. To his sisters, both
      of whom are married and ladies of the world, I have appealed with equal
      results. They refuse to regard me otherwise than as his mistress. But I
      cannot bear to see that great man, with that mind, that talent, doing
      himself to death. And when he is not under the influence of his drug, who
      is so great? Who has the wit, the wisdom, the heart, the charm, of
      Monsieur Edouard? Who can paint like him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, as a last resource, I take up my pen to ask you for assistance.
      If you could see him your heart would be moved. He is so thin, so thin,
      and his face has become <i>blue</i>, yes, blue, like the face of a dead
      man. Help me to save him from himself. If you can send me a note of five
      hundred francs, I can pay off our indebtedness here, and bring him back to
      France, where, in a sane country, far from a town, again I can reduce him
      to a few drops of laudanum a day, and again see him in health and at work.
      That which it costs me to make this request of you, I have not the words
      to tell you. But, at the end ot my forces, having no other means, no other
      support, I confide myself to your well-tried amity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you a good kiss. Jeanne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If the reading of this letter brought a lump into my throat and something
      like tears into my eyes&mdash;if I hastened to a banker&rsquo;s, and sent
      P&rsquo;tit-Bleu the money she asked for, by telegraph&mdash;if I reproached her
      bitterly and sincerely for not having applied to me long before,&mdash;I
      hope you will believe that it wasn&rsquo;t for the sake of Monsieur Edouard.
    </p>
    <p>
      They established themselves at St. Etienne, a hamlet on the coast of
      Normandy, to be farther from Paris. Dieppe was their nearest town. They
      lived at St.-Etienne for nearly three years. But, periodically, when she
      had got her house of cards nicely built up&mdash;piff!&mdash;he would walk
      into Dieppe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked into Dieppe one day in the autumn of 1885, and it took her a
      week to find him. He was always ill, after one of his grand debauches.
      This time he was worse than he had ever been before. I can imagine the
      care with which she nursed him, her anxious watching by his bedside, her
      prayers, her hopes, the blankness when he died.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came back to Paris, and called three times at my lodgings. But I was
      in England, and didn&rsquo;t receive the notes she left till nearly six months
      afterwards. I have never seen her since, never heard from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      What has become of her? It is not pleasant to conjecture. Of course, after
      his death, she ought to have died too. But the Angel of this Life,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Whose care is lest men see too much at once,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      couldn&rsquo;t permit any such satisfying termination. So she has simply
      disappeared, and, in the flesh, may have come to... one would rather not
      conjecture. All the same, I can&rsquo;t believe that in the spirit she will have
      made utter shipwreck. I can&rsquo;t believe that nothing permanent was won by
      those long years of love and pain. Her house of cards was toppled over, as
      often as she built it up; but perhaps she was all the while building
      another house, a house not made with hands, a house, a temple,
      indestructible.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      THE HOUSE OF EULALIE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was a pretty
      little house, in very charming country&mdash;in an untravelled corner of
      Normandy, near the sea; a country of orchards and colza fields, of soft
      green meadows where cattle browsed, and of deep elm-shaded lanes.
    </p>
    <p>
      One was rather surprised to see this little house just here, for all the
      other houses in the neighbourhood were rude farm-houses or labourers&rsquo;
      cottages; and this was a coquettish little chalet, white-walled, with slim
      French windows, and balconies of twisted ironwork, and Venetian blinds: a
      gay little pleasure-house, standing in a bright little garden, among
      rosebushes, and parterres of geraniums, and smooth stretches of
      greensward. Beyond the garden there was an orchard&mdash;rows and couples
      of old gnarled apple-trees, bending towards one another like fantastic
      figures arrested in the middle of a dance. Then, turning round, you looked
      over feathery colza fields and yellow corn fields, a mile away, to the
      sea, and to a winding perspective of white cliffs, which the sea bathed in
      transparent greens and purples, luminous shadows of its own nameless hues.
    </p>
    <p>
      A board attached to the wall confirmed, in roughly painted characters, the
      information I had had from an agent in Dieppe. The house was to let; and I
      had driven out&mdash;a drive of two long hours&mdash;to inspect it. Now I
      stood on the doorstep and rang the bell. It was a big bell, hung in the
      porch, with a pendent handle of bronze, wrought in the semblance of a rope
      and tassel. Its voice would carry far on that still country air.
    </p>
    <p>
      It carried, at any rate, as far as a low thatched farm-house, a hundred
      yards down the road. Presently a man and a woman came out of the
      farm-house, gazed for an instant in my direction, and then moved towards
      me: an old brown man, an old grey woman, the man in corduroys, the woman
      wearing a neat white cotton cap and a blue apron, both moving with the
      burdened gait of peasants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are Monsieur and Madame Leroux?&rdquo; I asked, when we had accomplished
      our preliminary good-days; and I explained that I had come from the agent
      in Dieppe to look over their house. For the rest, they must have been
      expecting me; the agent had said that he would let them know.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, to my perplexity, this business-like announcement seemed somehow to
      embarrass them; even, I might have thought, to agitate, to distress them.
      They lifted up their worn old faces, and eyed me anxiously. They exchanged
      anxious glances with each other. The woman clasped her hands, nervously
      working her fingers. The man hesitated and stammered a little, before he
      was able to repeat vaguely, &ldquo;You have come to look over the house,
      Monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the agent has written to you? I understood from him
      that you would expect me at this hour to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; the man admitted, &ldquo;we were expecting you.&rdquo; But he made no motion
      to advance matters. He exchanged another anxious glance with his wife. She
      gave her head a sort of helpless nod, and looked down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Monsieur,&rdquo; the man began, as if he were about to elucidate the
      situation, &ldquo;you see&mdash;&rdquo; But then he faltered, frowning at the air, as
      one at a loss for words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house is already let, perhaps?&rdquo; suggested I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the house is not let,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better go and fetch the key,&rdquo; his wife said at last, in a dreary
      way, still looking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      He trudged heavily back to the farm-house. While he was gone we stood by
      the door in silence, the woman always nervously working the fingers of her
      clasped hands. I tried, indeed, to make a little conversation: I ventured
      something about the excellence of the site, the beauty of the view. She
      replied with a murmur of assent, civilly but wearily; and I did not feel
      encouraged to persist.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by her husband rejoined us, with the key; and they began silently
      to lead me through the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two pretty drawing-rooms on the ground floor, a pretty
      dining-room, and a delightful kitchen, with a broad hearth of polished red
      bricks, a tiled chimney, and shining copper pots and pans. The
      drawing-rooms and the dining-room were pleasantly furnished in a light
      French fashion, and their windows opened to the sun and to the fragrance
      and greenery of the garden. I expressed a good deal of admiration;
      whereupon, little by little, the manner of my conductors changed. From
      constrained, depressed, it became responsive; even, in the end, effusive.
      They met my exclamations with smiles, my inquiries with voluble eager
      answers. But it remained an agitated manner, the manner of people who were
      shaken by an emotion. Their old hands trembled as they opened the doors
      for me or drew up the blinds; their voices trembled. There was something
      painful in their very smiles, as if these were but momentary ripples on
      the surface of a trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; I said to myself, &ldquo;they are hard-pressed for money. They have put
      their whole capital into this house, very likely. They are excited by the
      prospect of securing a tenant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, if you please, Monsieur, we will go upstairs, and see the bedrooms,&rdquo;
       the old man said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bedrooms were airy, cheerful rooms, gaily papered, with chintz
      curtains and the usual French bedroom furniture. One of them exhibited
      signs of being actually lived in; there were things about it, personal
      things, a woman&rsquo;s things. It was the last room we visited, a front room,
      looking off to the sea. There were combs and brushes on the toilet-table;
      there were pens, an inkstand, and a portfolio on the writing-desk; there
      were books in the bookcase. Framed photographs stood on the mantelpiece.
      In the closet dresses were suspended, and shoes and slippers were primly
      ranged on the floor. The bed was covered with a counterpane of blue silk;
      a crucifix hung on the wall above it; beside it there was a <i>prie-dieu</i>,
      with a little porcelain holy-water vase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I exclaimed, turning to Monsieur and Madame Leroux, &ldquo;this room is
      occupied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Leroux did not appear to hear me. Her eyes were fixed in a dull
      stare before her, her lips were parted slightly. She looked tired, as if
      she would be glad when our tour through the house was finished. Monsieur
      Leroux threw his hand up towards the ceiling in an odd gesture, and said,
      &ldquo;No, the room is not occupied at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We went back downstairs, and concluded an agreement. I was to take the
      house for the summer. Madame Leroux would cook for me. Monsieur Leroux
      would drive into Dieppe on Wednesday to fetch me and my luggage out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      On Wednesday we had been driving for something like half an hour without
      speaking, when all at once Leroux said to me, &ldquo;That room, Monsieur, the
      room you thought was occupied&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; I questioned, as he paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a proposition to make,&rdquo; said he. He spoke, as it seemed to me,
      half shyly, half doggedly, gazing the while at the ears of his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will leave that room as it is, with the things in it, we will make
      a reduction in the rent. If you will let us keep it as it is?&rdquo; he
      repeated, with a curious pleading intensity. &ldquo;You are alone. The house
      will be big enough for you without that room, will it not, Monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course, I consented at once. If they wished to keep the room as it was,
      they were to do so, by all means.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, thank you very much. My wife will be grateful to you,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a little while longer we drove on without speaking. Presently, &ldquo;You
      are our first tenant. We have never let the house before,&rdquo; he volunteered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah? Have you had it long?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I built it. I built it, five, six, years ago,&rdquo; said he. Then, after a
      pause, he added, &ldquo;I built it for my daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice sank, as he said this. But one felt that it was only the
      beginning of something he wished to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      I invited him to continue by an interested, &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see what we are, my wife and I,&rdquo; he broke out suddenly. &ldquo;We are rough
      people, we are peasants. But my daughter, sir&rdquo;&mdash;he put his hand on my
      knee, and looked earnestly into my face&mdash;&ldquo;my daughter was as fine as
      satin, as fine as lace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned back to his horse, and again drove for a minute or two in
      silence. At last, always with his eyes on the horse&rsquo;s ears, &ldquo;There was not
      a lady in this country finer than my daughter,&rdquo; he went on, speaking
      rapidly, in a thick voice, almost as if to himself. &ldquo;She was beautiful,
      she had the sweetest character, she had the best education. She was
      educated at the convent, in Rouen, at the Sacré Cour. Six years&mdash;from
      twelve to eighteen&mdash;she studied at the convent. She knew English, sir&mdash;your
      language. She took prizes for history. And the piano! Nobody living can
      touch the piano as my daughter could. Well,&rdquo; he demanded abruptly, with a
      kind of fierceness, &ldquo;was a rough farm-house good enough for her?&rdquo; He
      answered his own question. &ldquo;No, Monsieur. You would not soil fine lace by
      putting it in a dirty box. My daughter was finer than lace. Her hands were
      softer than Lyons velvet. And oh,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;the sweet smell they had,
      her hands! It was good to smell her hands. I used to kiss them and smell
      them, as you would smell a rose.&rdquo; His voice died away at the reminiscence,
      and there was another interval of silence. By-and-by he began again, &ldquo;I
      had plenty of money. I was the richest farmer of this neighbourhood. I
      sent to Rouen for the best architect they have there. Monsieur Clermont,
      the best architect of Rouen, laureate of the Fine Arts School of Paris, he
      built that house for my daughter; he built it and furnished it, to make it
      fit for a countess, so that when she came home for good from the convent
      she should have a home worthy of her. Look at this, Monsieur. Would the
      grandest palace in the world be too good for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had drawn a worn red leather case from his pocket, and taken out a
      small photograph, which he handed to me. It was the portrait of a girl, a
      delicate-looking girl, of about seventeen. Her face was pretty, with the
      irregular prettiness not uncommon in France, and very sweet and gentle.
      The old man almost held his breath while I was examining the photograph.
      &ldquo;Est-elle gentille? Est-elle belle, Monsieur?&rdquo; he besought me, with a very
      hunger for sympathy, as I returned it. One answered, of course, what one
      could, as best one could. He, with shaking fingers, replaced the
      photograph in its case. &ldquo;Here, Monsieur,&rdquo; he said, extracting from an
      opposite compartment a little white card. It was the usual French memorial
      of mourning: an engraving of the Cross and Dove, under which was printed:
      &ldquo;Eulalie-Joséphine-Marie Leroux. Born the 16th May, 1874. Died the 12th
      August, 1892. Pray for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The good God knows what He does. I built that house for my daughter, and
      when it was built the good God took her away. We were mad with grief, my
      wife and I; but that could not save her. Perhaps we are still mad with
      grief,&rdquo; the poor old man said simply. &ldquo;We can think of nothing else. We
      never wish to speak of anything else. We could not live in the house&mdash;her
      house, without her. We never thought to let it. I built that house for my
      daughter, I furnished it for her, and when it was ready for her&mdash;she
      died. Was it not hard, Monsieur? How could I let the house to strangers?
      But lately I have had losses. I am compelled to let it, to pay my debts. I
      would not let it to everybody. You are an Englishman. Well, if I did not
      like you, I would not let it to you for a million English pounds. But I am
      glad I have let it to you. You will respect her memory. And you will allow
      us to keep that room&mdash;her room. We shall be able to keep it as it
      was, with her things in it. Yes, that room which you thought was occupied&mdash;that
      was my daughter&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Leroux was waiting for us in the garden of the chalet. She looked
      anxiously up at her husband as we arrived. He nodded his head, and called
      out, &ldquo;It is all right. Monsieur agrees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old woman took my hands, wringing them hysterically almost. &ldquo;Ah,
      Monsieur, you are very good,&rdquo; she said. She raised her eyes to mine. But I
      could not look into her eyes. There was a sorrow in them, an awfulness, a
      sacredness of sorrow, which, I felt, it would be like sacrilege for me to
      look at.
    </p>
    <p>
      We became good friends, the Leroux and I, during the three months I passed
      as their tenant. Madame, indeed, did for me and looked after me with a
      zeal that was almost maternal. Both of them, as the old man had said,
      loved above all things to talk of their daughter, and I hope I was never
      loth to listen. Their passion, their grief, their constant thought of her,
      appealed to one as very beautiful, as well as very touching. And something
      like a pale spirit of the girl seemed gently, sweetly, always to be
      present in the house, the house that Love had built for her, not guessing
      that Death would come, as soon as it was finished, and call her away. &ldquo;Oh,
      but it is a joy, Monsieur, that you have left us her room,&rdquo; the old couple
      were never tired of repeating. One day Madame took me up into the room,
      and showed me Eulalie&rsquo;s pretty dresses, her trinkets, her books, the
      handsomely bound books that she had won as prizes at the convent. And on
      another day she showed me some of Eulalie&rsquo;s letters, asking me if she
      hadn&rsquo;t a beautiful hand-writing, if the letters were not beautifully
      expressed. She showed me photographs of the girl at all ages; a lock of
      her hair; her baby clothes; the priest&rsquo;s certificate of her first
      communion; the bishop&rsquo;s certificate of her confirmation. And she showed me
      letters from the good sisters of the Sacred Heart, at Rouen, telling of
      Eulalie&rsquo;s progress in her studies, praising her conduct and her character.
      &ldquo;Oh, to think that she is gone, that she is gone!&rdquo; the old woman wailed,
      in a kind of helpless incomprehension, incredulity, of loss. Then, in a
      moment, she murmured, with what submissiveness she could, &ldquo;Le bon Dieu
      sait ce qu&rsquo;il fait,&rdquo; crossing herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 12th of August, the anniversary of her death, I went with them to
      the parish church, where a mass was said for the repose of Eulalie&rsquo;s soul.
      And the kind old curé afterwards came round, and pressed their hands, and
      spoke words of comfort to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In September I left them, returning to Dieppe. One afternoon I chanced to
      meet that same old curé in the high street there. We stopped and spoke
      together&mdash;naturally, of the Leroux, of what excellent people they
      were, of how they grieved for their daughter. &ldquo;Their love was more than
      love. They adored the child, they idolised her. I have never witnessed
      such affection,&rdquo; the curé told me. &ldquo;When she died, I seriously feared they
      would lose their reason. They were dazed, they were beside themselves; for
      a long while they were quite as if mad. But God is merciful. They have
      learned to live with their affliction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very beautiful,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the way they have sanctified her memory,
      the way they worship it. You know, of course, they keep her room, with her
      things in it, exactly as she left it. That seems to me very beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her room?&rdquo; questioned the curé, looking vague. &ldquo;What room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, didn&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; I wondered. &ldquo;Her bedroom in the chalet. They keep
      it as she left it, with all her things about, her books, her dresses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I follow you,&rdquo; the curé said. &ldquo;She never had a bedroom in
      the chalet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon. One of the front rooms on the first floor was her
      room,&rdquo; I informed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he shook his head. &ldquo;There is some mistake. She never lived in the
      chalet. She died in the old house. The chalet was only just finished when
      she died. The workmen were hardly out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it is you who must be mistaken; you must forget. I am quite
      sure. The Leroux have spoken of it to me times without number.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear sir,&rdquo; the curé insisted, &ldquo;I am not merely sure; I know. I
      attended the girl in her last agony. She died in the farm-house. They had
      not moved into the chalet. The chalet was being furnished. The last pieces
      of furniture were taken in the very day before her death. The chalet was
      never lived in. You are the only person who has ever lived in the chalet.
      I assure you of the fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that is very strange, that is very strange indeed.&rdquo; And
      for a minute I was bewildered, I did not know what to think. But only for
      a minute. Suddenly I cried out, &ldquo;Oh, I see&mdash;I see. I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw, I understood. Suddenly I saw the pious, the beautiful deception
      that these poor stricken souls had sought to practise on themselves; the
      beautiful, the fond illusion they had created for themselves. They had
      built the house for their daughter, and she had died just when it was
      ready for her. But they could not bear&mdash;they could not bear&mdash;to
      think that not for one little week even, not even for one poor little day
      or hour, had she lived in the house, enjoyed the house. That was the
      uttermost farthing of their sorrow, which they could not pay. They could
      not acknowledge it to their own stricken hearts. So, piously, reverently&mdash;with
      closed eyes as it were, that they might not know what they were doing&mdash;they
      had carried the dead girl&rsquo;s things to the room they had meant for her,
      they had arranged them there, they had said, &ldquo;This was her room; this <i>was</i>
      her room.&rdquo; They would not admit to themselves, they would not let
      themselves stop to think, that she had never, even for one poor night,
      slept in it, enjoyed it. They told a beautiful pious falsehood to
      themselves. It was a beautiful pious game of &ldquo;make-believe,&rdquo; which, like
      children, they could play together. And&mdash;the curé had said it: God is
      merciful. In the end they had been enabled to confuse their beautiful
      falsehood with reality, and to find comfort in it; they had been enabled
      to forget that their &ldquo;make-believe&rdquo; was a &ldquo;make-believe,&rdquo; and to mistake
      it for a beautiful comforting truth. The uttermost farthing of their
      sorrow, which they could not pay, was not exacted. They were suffered to
      keep it; and it became their treasure, precious to them as fine gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Falsehood&mdash;truth? Nay, I think there are illusions that are not
      falsehoods&mdash;that are Truth&rsquo;s own smiles of pity for us.

      THE QUEEN&rsquo;. PLEASURE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> am writing to you
      from a lost corner of the far south-east of Europe. The author of my
      guide-book, in his preface, observes that a traveller in this part of the
      world, &ldquo;unless he has some acquaintance with the local idioms, is liable
      to find himself a good deal bewildered about the names of places.&rdquo; On
      Thursday of last week I booked from Charing Cross, by way of Dover, Paris,
      and the Orient Express, for Vescova, the capital of Monterosso; and
      yesterday afternoon&mdash;having changed on Sunday, at Belgrade, from land
      to water, and steamed for close upon forty-eight hours down the Danube&mdash;I
      was put ashore at the town of <i>Bckob</i>, in the Principality of
      Tchermnogoria.
    </p>
    <p>
      I certainly might well have found myself a good deal bewildered; and if I
      did not&mdash;for I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t boast of much acquaintance with the
      local idioms&mdash;it was no doubt because this isn&rsquo;t my first visit to
      the country. I was here some years ago, and then I learned that <i>Bckob</i>
      is pronounced as nearly as may be Vscof, and that Tchermnogoria is
      Monterosso literally translated&mdash;<i>tchermnoe</i> (the dictionaries
      certify) meaning red, and <i>gora</i>, or <i>goria</i>, a hill, a
      mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is our fashion in England to speak of Monterosso, if we speak of it at
      all, as I have just done: we say the Principality of Monterosso. But if we
      were to inquire at the Foreign Office, I imagine they would tell us that
      our fashion of speaking is not strictly correct. In its own Constitution
      Monterosso describes itself as a <i>Krolevstvo</i>, and its Sovereign as
      the <i>Krol</i>; and in all treaties and diplomatic correspondence, <i>Krol</i>
      and <i>Krolevstvo</i> are recognised by those most authoritative
      lexicographers, the Powers, as equivalent respectively to King and
      Kingdom. Anyhow, call it what you will, Monterosso is geographically the
      smallest, though politically the eldest, of the lower Danubian States. (It
      is sometimes, by-the-bye, mentioned in the newspapers of Western Europe as
      one of the Balkan States, which can scarcely be accurate, since, as a
      glance at the map will show, the nearest spurs of the Balkan Mountains are
      a good hundred miles distant from its southern frontier.) Its area is
      under ten thousand square miles, but its reigning family, the
      Pavelovitches, have contrived to hold their throne, from generation to
      generation, through thick and thin, ever since Peter the Great set them on
      it, at the conclusion of his war with the Turks, in 1713.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vescova is rarely visited by English folk, lying, as it does, something
      like a two days&rsquo; journey off the beaten track, which leads through
      Belgrade and Sofia to Constantinople. But, should you ever chance to come
      here, you would be surprised to see what a fine town it is, with its
      population of upwards of a hundred thousand souls, its broad, well-paved
      streets, its substantial yellow-stone houses, its three theatres, its
      innumerable churches, its shops and cafés, its gardens, quays, monuments,
      its government offices, and its Royal Palace. I am speaking, of course, of
      the new town, the modern town, which has virtually sprung into existence
      since 1850, and which, the author of my guide-book says, &ldquo;disputes with
      Bukharest the title of the Paris of the South-east.&rdquo; The old town&mdash;the
      Turkish town, as they call it&mdash;is another matter: a nightmare-region
      of filthy alleys, open sewers, crumbling clay hovels, mud, stench, dogs,
      and dirty humanity, into which a well-advised foreigner will penetrate as
      seldom as convenient. Yet it is in the centre of the old town that the
      Cathedral stands, the Cathedral of Sankt Iakov, an interesting specimen of
      Fifteenth Century Saracenic, having been erected by the Sultan Mohammed
      II., as a mosque.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the Royal Palace I obtain a capital view from the window of my room in
      the Hôtel de Russie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A vast irregular pile,&rdquo; in the language of my guide-book, &ldquo;it is built on
      the summit of an eminence which dominates the town from the west.&rdquo; The
      &ldquo;eminence&rdquo; rises gradually from this side to a height of perhaps a hundred
      feet, but breaks off abruptly on the other in a sheer cliff overhanging
      the Danube. The older portions of the Palace spring from the very brink of
      the precipice, so that, leaning from their ramparts, you could drop a
      pebble straight into the current, an appalling depth below. And, still to
      speak by the book, these older portions &ldquo;vie with the Cathedral in
      architectural interest.&rdquo; What I see from my bedroom is a formidable,
      murderous-looking Saracenic castle: huge perpendicular quadrangles of
      blank, windowless, iron-grey stone wall (<i>curtains</i>, are they
      technically called?), connecting massive square towers; and the towers are
      surmounted by battlements and pierced by meurtrières. It stands out very
      bold and black, gloomy and impressive, when the sun sets behind it, in the
      late afternoon. I could suppose the place quite impregnable, if not
      inaccessible; and it&rsquo;s a mystery to me how Peter the Great ever succeeded
      in taking it, as History will have it that he did, by assault.
    </p>
    <p>
      The modern portions of the Palace are entirely commonplace and cheerful.
      The east wing, visible from where I am seated writing, might have been
      designed by Baron Haussmann: a long stretch of yellow façade&mdash;dazzling
      to the sight just now, in the morning sunshine&mdash;with a French roof,
      of slate, and a box of gay-tinted flowers in each of its countless
      windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the Palace there is a large and very lovely garden, reserved to the
      uses of the Royal Household; and beyond that, the Dunayskiy Prospekt, a
      park that covers about sixty acres, and is open to the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first floor, the <i>piano nobile</i>, of that east wing is occupied by
      the private apartments of the King and Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      I look across the quarter-mile of red-tiled housetops that separate me
      from their Majesties&rsquo; habitation, and I fancy the life that is going on
      within. It is too early in the day for either of them to be abroad, so
      they are certainly there, somewhere behind those gleaming windows:
      Theodore <i>Krol</i>t and Anéli <i>Kroleva</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, I would lay a wager, is in her music-room, at her piano, practising a
      song with Florimond. She is dressed in white (I always think of her as
      dressed in white&mdash;doubtless because she wore a white frock the first
      time I saw her), and her brown hair is curling loose about her forehead,
      her maids not having yet imprisoned it. I declare, I can almost hear her
      voice: <i>tra-la-lira-la-la</i>: mastering a trill; while Florimond, pink,
      and plump, and smiling, walks up and down the room, nodding his head to
      mark the time, and every now and then interrupting her with a suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King, at this hour, will be in his study, in dressing-gown and
      slippers&mdash;a tattered old dingy brown dressing-gown, out at elbows&mdash;at
      his big wildly-littered writing-table, producing &ldquo;copy,&rdquo; to the
      accompaniment of endless cigarettes and endless glasses of tea.
      (Monterossan cigarettes are excellent, and Monterossan tea is always
      served in glasses.) The King has literary aspirations, and&mdash;like
      Frederick the Great&mdash;coaxes his muse in French. You will occasionally
      see a <i>conte</i> of his in the <i>Nouvelle Revue</i>, signed by the
      artful pseudonym, Théodore Montrouge.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one o&rsquo;clock to-day I am to present myself at the Palace, and to be
      received by their Majesties in informal audience; and then I am to have
      the honour of lunching with them. If I were on the point of lunching with
      any other royal family in Europe.... But, thank goodness, I&rsquo;m not; and I
      needn&rsquo;t pursue the distressing speculation. Queen Anéli and King Theodore
      are&mdash;for a multitude of reasons&mdash;a Queen and King apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      You see, when he began life, Theodore IV. was simply Prince Theodore
      Pavelovitch, the younger son of a nephew of the reigning Krol, Paul III,;
      and nobody dimly dreamed that he would ever ascend the throne. So he went
      to Paris, and &ldquo;made his studies&rdquo; in the Latin Quarter, like any commoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days&mdash;as, I dare say, it still is in these&mdash;the Latin
      Quarter was crowded with students from the far South-east. Servians,
      Roumanians, Monte-rossans, grew, as it were, on every bush; we even had a
      sprinkling of Bulgarians and Montenegrins; and those of them who were not
      (more or less vaguely) princes, you could have numbered on your fingers.
      And, anyhow, in that democratic and self-sufficient seat of learning,
      titles count for little, and foreign countries are a matter of consummate
      ignorance and jaunty unconcern. The Duke of Plaza-Toro, should he venture
      in the classical Boul&rsquo; Miche, would have to cede the <i>pas</i> to the
      latest hero of the Beaux-Arts, or bully from the School of Medicine, even
      though the hero were the son of a village apothecary, and the bully reeked
      to heaven of absinthe and tobacco; while the Prime Minister of England
      would find his name, it is more than to be feared, unknown, and himself
      regarded as a person of quite extraordinary unimportance.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we accepted Prince Theodore Pavelovitch, and tried him by his
      individual merits, for all the world as if he were made of the same flesh
      and blood as Tom, Dick, and Harry; and thee-and-thou&rsquo;d him, and hailed him
      as <i>mon vieux</i>, as merrily as we did everybody else. Indeed, I
      shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if the majority of those who knew him were serenely
      unaware that his origin was royal (he would have been the last to apprise
      them of it), and roughly classed him with our other <i>princes valaques</i>.
      For convenience sake, we lumped them all&mdash;the divers natives of the
      lands between the Black Sea and the Adriatic&mdash;under the generic name,
      Valaques; we couldn&rsquo;t be bothered with nicer ethnological distinctions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We tried Prince Theodore by his individual merits; but, as his individual
      merits happened to be signal, we liked him very much. He hadn&rsquo;t a trace of
      &ldquo;side;&rdquo; his pockets were full of money; he was exceedingly free-handed. No
      man was readier for a lark, none more inventive or untiring in the
      prosecution of one. He was a brilliant scholar, besides, and almost the
      best fencer in the Quarter. And he was pleasantly good-looking&mdash;fair-haired,
      blue-eyed, with a friendly humorous face, a pointed beard, and a slight,
      agile, graceful figure. Everybody liked him, and everybody was sorry when
      he had to leave us, and return to his ultra-mundane birthplace. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t
      be helped,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I must go home and do three years of military
      service. But then I shall come back. I mean always to live in Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was in &rsquo;82. But he never came back. For, before his three years of
      military service were completed, the half-dozen cousins and the brother
      who stood between him and the throne, had one by one died off, and
      Theodore himself had succeeded to the dignity of <i>Krolevitch</i>,&mdash;as
      they call their Heir-Presumptive. In 1886 he married. And, finally, in
      &rsquo;88, his great-uncle Paul also died&mdash;at the age of ninety-seven, if
      you please&mdash;and Theodore was duly proclaimed Krol.
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn&rsquo;t forget his ancient cronies, though; and I was only one of those
      whom he invited to come and stay with him in his Palace. I came, and
      stayed.... eleven months! That seems egregious; but what will you say of
      another of us, Arthur Fleet (or Florimond, as their Majesties have
      nicknamed him), who came at the same time, and has stayed ever since? The
      fact is, the King is a tenacious as well as a delightful host; if he once
      gets you within his portals, he won&rsquo;t let you go without a struggle. &ldquo;We
      do bore ourselves so improbably out here, you know,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;The
      society of a Christian is a thing we&rsquo;d commit a crime for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Theodore&rsquo;s consort, Anéli Isabella, <i>Kroleva Tcherrnnogory&mdash;vide</i>
      the <i>Almanach de Gotha</i>&mdash;is the third daughter of the late
      Prince Maximilian of Wittenburg; sister, therefore, to that young Prince
      Waldemar who comes almost every year to England, and with whose name and
      exploits as a yachtsman all conscientious students of the daily press will
      be familiar; and cousin to the reigning Grand Duke Ernest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theoretically German, she is, however, to all intents and purposes,
      French; for her mother, the Princess Célestine (of Bourbon-Morbihan), was
      a Frenchwoman, and, until her marriage, I fancy that more than half of
      Anéli&rsquo;s life was passed between Nice and Paris. She openly avows,
      moreover, that she &ldquo;detests Germany, the German language, the German
      people, and all things German, and adores France and the French.&rdquo; And her
      political sympathies are entirely with the Franco-Russ alliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is a deliciously pretty little lady, with curling soft-brown hair, a
      round, very young-looking face, a delicate rose-and-ivory complexion, and
      big, bright, innocent brown eyes&mdash;innocent, yet with plenty of
      potential archness, even potential mischief, lurking in them. She has
      beautiful full red lips, besides, and exquisite little white teeth.
      Florimond wrote a triolet about her once, in which he described her as
      &ldquo;une fleur en porcelaine.&rdquo; Her Majesty repudiated the phrase indignantly.
      &ldquo;Why not say a wax-doll, and be done with it?&rdquo; she demanded. All the same,
      &ldquo;fleur en porcelaine&rdquo; does, in a manner, suggest the general effect of her
      appearance, its daintiness, its finish, its crisp chiselling, its clear,
      pure colour. Whereas, nothing could be more misleading than &ldquo;wax-doll,&rdquo;
       for there is character, character, in every molecule of her person.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen&rsquo;s character, indeed, is what I wish I could give some idea of It
      is peculiar, it is distinctive; to me, at any rate, it is infinitely
      interesting and diverting; but, by the same token&mdash;if I may hazard so
      to qualify it&mdash;it is a trifle.... a trifle.... difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re such an arbitrary gent!&rdquo; I heard Florimond complain to her, one
      day. (I heard and trembled, but the Queen only laughed.) And that will
      give you an inkling of what I mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she likes you, if you amuse her, and if you never remotely oppose or
      question her desire of the moment, she can be all that is most gracious,
      most reasonable, most captivating: an inspiring listener, an entertaining
      talker: mingling the naïveté, the inexperience of evil, the half comical,
      half appealing unsophistication, of a girl, of a child almost&mdash;of one
      who has always lived far aloof from the struggle and uncleanness of the
      workaday world&mdash;with the wit, the humour, the swift appreciation and
      responsiveness of an exceedingly impressionable, clear-sighted, and
      accomplished woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      But... but....
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I suppose, the right way of putting it would be to say, in the
      consecrated formula, that she has the defects of her qualities. Having
      preserved something of a child&rsquo;s simplicity, she has not entirely lost a
      child&rsquo;s wilfulness, a child&rsquo;s instability of mood, a child&rsquo;s trick of
      wearing its heart upon its sleeve. She has never perfectly acquired a
      grown person&rsquo;s power of controlling or concealing her emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you <i>don&rsquo;t</i> happen to amuse her&mdash;if, by any chance, it is
      your misfortune to <i>bore</i> her, no matter how slightly; and, oh, she
      is so easily bored!&mdash;the atmosphere changes in a twinkling: the sun
      disappears, clouds gather, the temperature falls, and (unless you speedily
      &ldquo;brisken up,&rdquo; or fly her presence) you may prepare for most uncomfortable
      weather. If you manifest the faintest hesitation in complying with her
      momentary wishes, if you raise the mildest objection to them&mdash;<i>gare
      à vous!</i> Her face darkens, ominous lightning flashes in her eyes, her
      under-lip swells dangerously; she very likely stamps her foot imperiously;
      and you are to be accounted lucky if you don&rsquo;t get a smart dab from the
      barbed end of her royal tongue. And if she doesn&rsquo;t like you, though she
      may think she is trying with might and main to disguise the fact and to
      treat you courteously, you know it directly, and you go away with the
      persuasion that she has been, not merely cold and abstracted, but
      downright uncivil.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a word, Queen Anéli is hasty, she is impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, in addition to that, she is uncertain. You can never tell beforehand,
      by any theory of probabilities based on past experience, what will or will
      not, on any given occasion, cause her to smile or frown. The thing she
      expressed a desire for yesterday, may offend her to-day, The suggestion
      that offended her yesterday, to-day she may welcome with joyous
      enthusiasm. You must approach her gingerly, tentatively; you must feel
      your ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, most dread Sovereign,&rdquo; said Florimond, &ldquo;if you won&rsquo;t fly out at me, I
      would submit, humbly, that you&rsquo;d better not drive this afternoon in your
      victoria, in your sweet new frock, for, unless all signs fail, it&rsquo;s going
      to rain like everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She didn&rsquo;t fly out at him exactly; but she retorted succinctly, with a
      peremptory gesture, &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s <i>not</i> going to rain,&rdquo; as who should
      say, &ldquo;It daren&rsquo;t.&rdquo; And she drove in her victoria, and spoiled her sweet
      new frock. &ldquo;Not to speak of my sweet new top-hat,&rdquo; sighs Florimond, who
      attended her; &ldquo;the only Lincoln and Bennett topper in the whole length and
      breadth of Monterosso.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She is hasty, she is uncertain; and then... she is <i>intense</i>. She
      talks in italics, she feels in superlatives; she admits no comparative
      degree, no emotional half-tones. When she is not <i>ecstatically</i>
      happy, she is <i>desperately</i> miserable; wonders why she was ever born
      into this worst of all possible worlds; wishes she were dead; and even
      sometimes drops dark hints of meditated suicide. When she is not in the
      brightest of affable humours, she is in the blackest of cross ones. She
      either <i>loves</i> a thing, or she <i>simply can&rsquo;t endure it</i>;&mdash;the
      thing may be a town, a musical composition, a perfume, or a person. She
      either loves you, or simply can&rsquo;t endure you; and she&rsquo;s very apt to love
      you and to cease to love you alternately&mdash;or, at least, to give you
      to understand as much&mdash;three or four times a day. It is winter
      midnight or summer noon, a climate of extremes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like the smell of tangerine-skin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every evening for a week, when, at the end of dinner, the fruit was handed
      round, the King asked her that question; and she, never suspecting his
      malice, answered invariably, as she crushed a bit between her fingers, and
      fervidly inhaled its odour, &ldquo;Oh, do I <i>like</i> it? I <i>adore</i> it.
      It&rsquo;s perfect <i>rapture</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She is hasty, she is uncertain, she is intense. Will you be surprised when
      I go on to insist that, down deep, she is altogether well-meaning and
      excessively tender-hearted, and when I own that among all the women I know
      I can think of none other who seems to me so attractive, so fascinating,
      so sweetly feminine and loveable? (Oh, no, I am not <i>in love</i> with
      her, not in the least&mdash;though I don&rsquo;t say that I mightn&rsquo;t be, if I
      were a king, or she were not a queen.) If she realises that she has been
      unreasonable, she is the first to confess it; she repents honestly, and
      makes the devoutest resolutions to amend. If she discovers that she has
      hurt anybody&rsquo;s feelings, her conscience will not give her a single second
      of peace, until she has sought her victim out and heaped him with
      benefits. If she believes that this or that distasteful task forms in very
      truth a part of her duty, she will go to any length of persevering
      self-sacrifice to accomplish it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She has a hundred generous and kindly impulses, where she has one that is
      perverse or inconsiderate. Bring any case of distress or sorrow to her
      notice, and see how instantly her eyes soften, how eager she is to be of
      help. And in her affections, however mercurial she may appear on the
      surface, she is really constant, passionate, and, in great things,
      forbearing. She and her husband, for example, though they have been
      married perilously near ten years, are little better than a pair of
      sweethearts (and jealous sweethearts, at that: you should have been
      present on a certain evening when we had been having a long talk and laugh
      over old days in the Latin Quarter, and an evil spirit prompted one of us
      to regale her Majesty with a highly-coloured account of Theodore&rsquo;s
      youthful infatuation for Nina Childe!... Oh, their faces! Oh, the silence!
      ); and then, witness her devotion to her brother, to her sisters; her
      fondness for Florimond, for Madame Donarowska, who was her governess when
      she was a girl, and now lives with her in the Palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am writing a fairy-tale,&rdquo; Florimond said to her &ldquo;about Princess
      Gugglegoo and Princess Raggle-snag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; questioned the Queen. &ldquo;And who were <i>they?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Princess Gugglegoo was all sweetness and pinkness, softness and
      guilelessness, a rose full of honey, and without a thorn; a perfect little
      cherub; oh, such a duck! Princess Ragglesnag was all corners and sharp
      edges, fire and fret, dark moods and quick angers; oh, such an intolerant,
      dictatorial, explosive, tempestuous princess! You could no more touch her
      than you could touch a nettle, or a porcupine, or a live coal, or a Leyden
      jar, or any other prickly, snaggy, knaggy, incandescent, electric thing.
      You were obliged to mind your p&rsquo;s and q&rsquo;s with her! But no matter how
      carefully you minded them, she was sure to let you have it, sooner or
      later; you were sure to <i>rile</i> her, one way or another: she was that
      cantankerous and tetchy, and changeable and unexpected.&mdash;And then....
      Well, what do you suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting to hear,&rdquo; the Queen replied, a little drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there! If you&rsquo;re going to be grumpy, ma&rsquo;am, I won&rsquo;t play,&rdquo; cried
      Florimond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not grumpy. Only, your characters are rather conventionally drawn.
      However, go on, go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a distinct suggestion of menace in your tone. But never mind.
      If you didn&rsquo;t really mean it, we&rsquo;ll pretend there wasn&rsquo;t.&mdash;Well, my
      dears,&rdquo; he went on, turning, so as to include the King in his audience,
      &ldquo;you never <i>will</i> believe me, but it&rsquo;s a solemn, sober fact that
      these two princesses were twin sisters, and that they looked so much alike
      that nobody, not even their own born mother, could tell them apart. Now,
      wasn&rsquo;t <i>that</i> surprising? Only Ragglesnag looked like Gugglegoo
      suddenly curdled and gone sour, you know; and Gugglegoo looked like
      Ragglesnag suddenly wreathed out in smiles and graces. So that the
      courtiers used to say &rsquo;Hello! What <i>can</i> have happened? Here comes
      dear Princess Gugglegoo looking as black as thunder.&rsquo; Or else&mdash;&rsquo;Bless
      us and save us! What&rsquo;s <i>this</i> miracle? Here comes old Ragglesnag
      looking as if butter wouldn&rsquo;t melt in her mouth,&rsquo; Well, and then....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t continue,&rdquo; the Queen interrupted, bridling. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      tedious and obvious, and utterly unfair and unjust. I hope I&rsquo;m not an
      insipid little fool, like Gugglegoo; but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m quite a
      termagant, either, like your horrid exaggerated Ragglesnag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear! Oh, dear!&rdquo; wailed Florimond. &ldquo;Why <i>will</i> people go and
      make a personal application or everything a fellow says? If I had been
      even remotely thinking of your Majesty, I should never have dreamed of
      calling her by either of those ridiculous outlandish names. Gugglegoo and
      Ragglesnag, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>would</i> you have called her?&rdquo; the King asked, who was chuckling
      inscrutably in his armchair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I <i>might</i> have called her Ragglegoo, and I <i>might</i> have
      called her Gugglesnag. But I hope I&rsquo;m much too discerning ever to have
      applied such a sweeping generalisation to her as Ragglesnag, or such a
      silly, sugary sort of barbarism as Gugglegoo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly useless,&rdquo; the Queen broke out, bitterly, &ldquo;to expect a <i>man</i>&mdash;even
      a comparatively intelligent and highly-developed man, like Florimond&mdash;to
      understand the subtleties of a woman&rsquo;s nature, or to sympathise with the
      difficulties of her life. When she isn&rsquo;t as crude, and as blunt, and as
      phlegmatic, and as insensitive, and as transparent and commonplace and
      all-of-one-piece as themselves, men always think a woman&rsquo;s unreasonable
      and capricious and infantile. It&rsquo;s a little <i>too</i> discouraging. Here
      I wear myself to a shadow, and bore and worry myself to extermination,
      with all the petty contemptible cares and bothers and pomps and ceremonies
      of this tiresome little Court; and that&rsquo;s all the thanks I get&mdash;to be
      laughed at by my husband, and lectured and ridiculed in stupid allegories
      by Florimond! It&rsquo;s a little <i>too</i> hard. Oh, if you&rsquo;d only let me go
      away, and leave it all behind me! I&rsquo;d go to Paris and change my name, and
      become a concert-singer. It&rsquo;s the only thing I really care for&mdash;to
      sing and sing and sing. Oh, if I could only go and make a career as a
      concert-singer in Paris! Will you let me? Will you? <i>Will</i> you?&rdquo; she
      demanded, vehemently, of her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather a radical measure to bring up for discussion at this hour
      of the night, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; the King suggested, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s quite serious enough for you to afford to consider it. And I
      don&rsquo;t see why one hour isn&rsquo;t as good as another. <i>Will</i> you let me go
      to Paris and become a concert-singer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! And leave poor me alone and forlorn here in Vescova? Oh, my dear,
      you wouldn&rsquo;t desert your own lawful spouse in that regardless manner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what &rsquo;lawful&rsquo; has to do with it. You don&rsquo;t half appreciate
      me. You think I&rsquo;m childish, and capricious, and bad-tempered, and
      everything that&rsquo;s absurd and idiotic. I don&rsquo;t see why I should waste my
      life and my youth, stagnating in this out-of-the-way corner of Nowhere,
      with a man who doesn&rsquo;t appreciate me, and who thinks I&rsquo;m childish and
      idiotic, when I could go to Paris and have a life of my own, and a career,
      and do the only thing in the world I really care for. Will you let me go?
      Answer. Will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the King only laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; the Queen went on, in a minute, &ldquo;if you really missed me,
      you could come too. You could abdicate. Why shouldn&rsquo;t you? Instead of
      staying here, and boring and worrying ourselves to death as King and Queen
      of this ungrateful, insufferable, little unimportant ninth-rate
      make-believe of a country, why shouldn&rsquo;t we abdicate and go to Paris, and
      be a Man and a Woman, and have a little Life, instead of this dreary,
      artificial, cardboard sort of puppet-show existence? You could devote
      yourself to literature, and I&rsquo;d go on the concert-stage, and we&rsquo;d have a
      delightful little house in the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne, and be
      perfectly happy. Of course, Flori-mond would come with us. Why shouldn&rsquo;t
      we? Oh, if you only would Î Will you? Will you, Theo?&rdquo; she pleaded
      earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King looked at his watch. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nearly midnight, my dear,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;High time, I should think, to adjourn the debate. But if, when you wake
      up to-morrow morning, you wish to resume it, Flori-mond and I will be at
      your disposal. Meanwhile, we&rsquo;re losing our beauty-sleep; and I, for one,
      am going to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s always like that!&rdquo; the Queen complained. &ldquo;You never do me the
      honour of taking seriously anything I say. It&rsquo;s intolerable. I don&rsquo;t think
      any woman was ever so badly treated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She didn&rsquo;t recur to the subject next day, however, but passed the entire
      morning with Florimond, planning the details of a garden-party, and
      editing the list of guests; and she threw her whole soul into it too. So
      that, when the King looked in upon them a little before luncheon,
      Florimond smiled at him significantly (indeed, I&rsquo;m not sure he didn&rsquo;t <i>wink</i>
      at him) and called out, &ldquo;Oh, we <i>are</i> enjoying ourselves. Please
      don&rsquo;t interrupt. Go back to your counting-house and count out your money,
      and leave us in the parlour to eat our bread and honey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is in the nature of things, doubtless, that a temperament such as I
      have endeavoured to suggest should find the intensity of its own feelings
      reflected by those that it excites in others. One would expect to hear
      that the people who like Queen Anéli like her tremendously, and that the
      people who don&rsquo;t like her tremendously don&rsquo;t like her at all. And, in
      effect, that is precisely the lady&rsquo;s case. She is tremendously liked by
      those who are near to her, and who are therefore in a position to
      understand her and to make allowances. They love the woman in her; they
      laugh at and love the high-spirited, whimsical, impetuous, ingenuous
      child. But those who are at a distance from her, or who meet her only
      rarely and formally, necessarily fail to understand her, and are apt,
      accordingly, neither to admire her greatly, nor to bear her much good
      will. And, of course, while the people who are near to her can be named by
      twos and threes, those who view her from a distance must be reckoned with
      by thousands. And this brings me to a painful circumstance, which I may as
      well mention without more ado. At Vescova&mdash;as you could scarcely
      spend a day in the town and not become aware&mdash;Queen Anéli is anything
      you please but popular.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The inhabitants of Monterosso,&rdquo; says M. Boridov, in his interesting
      history of that country, &ldquo;fall into three rigidly separated castes: the
      nobility, a bare handful of tall, fair-haired, pure-blooded Slavs; the
      merchants and manufacturers, almost exclusively Jews and Germans; and the
      peasantry, the populace&mdash;a short, thick-set, swarthy race, of Slavic
      origin, no doubt, and speaking a Slavic tongue, but with most of the
      Slavic characteristics obliterated by admixture with the Turk.... Your
      true Slav peasant, with his mild blue eyes and his trustful spirit, is as
      meek and as long-suffering as a dumb beast of burden. But your
      black-browed Monterossan, your Tchermnogorets, is fierce, lawless,
      resentful, and vindictive, a Turk&rsquo;s grandson, the Turk&rsquo;s first cousin:
      though no one detests the Turk more cordially than he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, at Vescova, and, with diminishing force, throughout all Monterosso,
      Queen Anéli is entirely misunderstood and sullenly misliked. Her husband
      cannot be called precisely the idol of his people, either; but he is
      regarded with indulgence, even with hopefulness; he is a Monterossan, a
      Pavelovitch: he may turn out well yet. Anéli, on the contrary, is an
      alien, a German, a <i>Niemkashka</i>. The feeling against her begins with
      the nobility. Save the half-dozen who are about her person, almost every
      mother&rsquo;s son or daughter of them fancies that he or she has been rudely
      treated by her, and quite frankly hates her. I am afraid, indeed, they
      have some real cause of grievance; for they are most of them rather
      tedious, and provincial, and narrow-minded; and they bore her terribly
      when they come to Court; and when she is bored, as we have seen, she is
      likely to show it pretty plainly. So they say she gives herself airs. They
      pretend that when she isn&rsquo;t absent-minded and monosyllabic, she is
      positively snappish. They denounce her as vain, shallow-pated, and
      extravagant. They twist and torture every word she speaks, and everything
      she does, into subject-matter for unfriendly criticism; and they quote as
      from her lips a good many words that she has never spoken, and they blame
      her savagely for innumerable things that she has never thought of doing.
      But that&rsquo;s the trouble with the fierce light that beats upon a throne&mdash;it
      shows the gaping multitude so much more than is really there. Why, I have
      been assured by at least a score of Monterossan ladies that the Queen&rsquo;s
      lovely brown hair is a wig; that her exquisite little teeth are the
      creation of Dr. Evans, of Paris; that whenever anything happens to annoy
      her, she bursts out with torrents of the most awful French oaths; that she
      quite frequently slaps and pinches her maids-of-honour; and that, as for
      her poor husband, he gets his hair pulled and his face scratched as often
      as he and she have the slightest difference of opinion. Monterossan ladies
      have gravely asseverated these charges to me (these, and others more
      outrageous, which I won&rsquo;t repeat), whilst their Monterossan lords nodded
      confirmation. It matters little that the charges are preposterous. Give a
      Queen a bad name, and nine people in ten will believe she merits it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow, the nobility of Monterosso, quite frankly hating Queen Anéli,
      give her every bad name they can discover in their vocabularies; and the
      populace, the mob, without stopping to make original investigations, have
      convicted her on faith, and watch her with sullen captiousness and
      mislike. When she drives abroad, scarcely a hat is doffed, never a cheer
      is raised. On the contrary, one sometimes hears mutterings and muffled
      groans; and the glances the passers-by direct at her are, in the main, the
      very reverse of affectionate glances. Members of the shop-keeping class
      alone show a certain tendency to speak up for her, because she spends her
      money pretty freely; but the shop-keeping class are aliens too, and don&rsquo;t
      count&mdash;or, rather, they count against her, &rsquo;the dogs of Jews,&rsquo; the <i>zhudovskwy
      sobakwy!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But do you imagine Queen Anéli minds? Do you imagine she is hurt,
      depressed, disappointed? Not she. She accepts her unpopularity with the
      most superb indifference. &ldquo;What do you suppose I care for the opinion of
      such riff-raff?&rdquo; I recollect her once crying out, with curling lip. &ldquo;Any
      one who has the least individuality, the least character, the least
      fineness, the least originality&mdash;any one who is in the least degree
      natural, unconventional, spontaneous&mdash;is bound to be misconceived and
      caluminated by the vulgar rank and file. It&rsquo;s the meanness and stupidity
      of average human nature; it&rsquo;s the proverbial injustice of men. To be
      popular, you must either be utterly insignificant, a complete nonentity,
      or else a timeserver and a hypocrite. So long as I have a clear conscience
      of my own, I don&rsquo;t care a button what strangers think and say about me. I
      don&rsquo;t intend to allow my conduct to be influenced in the tiniest
      particular by the prejudices of outsiders. Meddlers, busybodies! I will
      live my own life, and those who don&rsquo;t like it may do their worst. I will
      be myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear; but after all,&rdquo; the King reminded her, &ldquo;one has, in this
      imperfect world, to make certain compromises with one&rsquo;s environment, for
      comfort&rsquo;s sake. One puts on extra clothing in winter, for example, however
      much, on abstract principles, one may despise such a gross, material,
      unintelligent thing as the weather. Just so, don&rsquo;t you think, one is by
      way of having a smoother time of it, in the long run, if one takes a few
      simple measures to conciliate the people amongst whom one is compelled to
      live? Now, for instance, if you would give an hour or two every day to
      learning Monterossan....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t begin <i>that</i> rengaine,&rdquo; cried her
      Majesty. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you a hundred million times that I won&rsquo;t be bothered
      learning Monterossan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is one of her subjects&rsquo; sorest points, by the bye, that she has never
      condescended to learn their language. When she was first married, indeed,
      she announced her intention of studying it. Grammars and dictionaries were
      bought; a Professor was nominated; and for almost a week the Crown
      Princess (Krolevna), as she then was, did little else than grind at
      Monterossan. Her Professor was delighted; he had never known such a
      zealous pupil. Her husband was a little anxious. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t work too
      hard, my dear. An hour or two a day should be quite enough.&rdquo; But she
      answered, &ldquo;Let me alone. It interests me.&rdquo; And for almost a week she was
      at it early and late, with hammer and tongs; poring over the endless
      declensions of Monterossan nouns, the endless conjugations of Monterossan
      verbs; wrestling, <i>sotto voce</i>, with the tongue-tangling difficulties
      of Monterossan pronunciation; or, with dishevelled hair and inky fingers,
      copying long Monterossan sentences into her exercise book. She is not the
      sort of person who does things by halves.&mdash;And then, suddenly, she
      turned volte-face; abandoned the enterprise for ever. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s idiotic,&rdquo; she
      exclaimed. &ldquo;A language with thirty-seven letters in its alphabet, and no
      literature! Why should I addle my brains trying to learn it? Ah, bien,
      merci! I&rsquo;ll content myself with French and English. It&rsquo;s bad enough, in
      one short life, to have had to learn German, when I was a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And neither argument nor entreaty could induce her to recommence it. The
      King, who has never altogether resigned himself to her determination,
      seizes from time to time an opportunity to hark back to it; but then he is
      silenced, as we have seen, with a &ldquo;don&rsquo;t begin <i>that</i> rengaine.&rdquo; The
      disadvantages that result from her ignorance, it must be noticed, are
      chiefly moral; it offends Monterossan amour-propre. Practically, she does
      perfectly well with French, that being the Court language of the realm.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, Queen Anéli doesn&rsquo;t care a button. She tosses her head, and accepts
      &ldquo;the proverbial injustice of men&rdquo; with magnificent unconcern. Only,
      sometimes, when the public sentiment against her takes the form of
      aggressive disrespect, or when it interferes in any way with her immediate
      convenience, it puts her a little out of patience&mdash;when, for
      instance, the traffic in the street retards the progress of her carriage,
      and a passage isn&rsquo;t cleared for her as rapidly as it might be for a Queen
      whom the rabble loved; or when, crossing the pavement on foot, to enter a
      church, or a shop, or what not, the idlers that collect to look, glare at
      her sulkily, without doing her the common courtesy of lifting their hats.
      In such circumstances, I dare say, she is more or less angered. At all
      events, a sudden fire will kindle in her eyes, a sudden colour in her
      cheeks; she will very likely tap nervously with her foot, and murmur
      something about &ldquo;canaille.&rdquo; Perhaps anger, though, is the wrong word for
      her emotion; perhaps it should be more correctly called a kind of angry
      contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I first came to Vescova, some years ago, the Prime Minister and
      virtual dictator of the country was still M. Tsargradev, the terrible M.
      Tsargradev,&mdash;or Sargradeff, as most English newspapers write his
      name,&mdash;and it was during my visit here that his downfall occurred,
      his downfall and irretrievable disgrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The character and career of M. Tsargradev would furnish the subject for an
      extremely interesting study. The illegitimate son of a Monterossan
      nobleman, by a peasant mother, he inherited the unprepossessing physical
      peculiarities of his mother&rsquo;s stock: the sallow skin, the broad face, the
      flat features, the prominent cheek-bones, the narrow, oblique-set,
      truculent black eyes, the squat, heavy figure. But to these he united a
      cleverness, an energy, an ambition, which are as foreign to simple as to
      gentle Monterossan blood, and which he doubtless owed to the fusion of the
      two; and an unscrupulousness, a perfidy, a cruelty, and yet a superficial
      urbanity, that are perhaps not surprising in an ambitious politician, half
      an Oriental, who has got to carry the double handicap of a repulsive
      personal appearance and a bastard birth. Now, the Government of
      Monterosso, as the King has sometimes been heard to stigmatise it, is
      deplorably constitutional. By the Constitution of 1869, practically the
      whole legislative power is vested in the Soviete, a parliament elected by
      the votes of all male subjects who have completed three years of military
      service. And, in the early days of the reign of Theodore IV., M.
      Tsargradev was leader of the Soviete, with a majority of three to one at
      his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      This redoubtable personage stood foremost in the ranks of those whom our
      fiery little Queen Anéli &ldquo;could not endure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His horrible soapy smile! His servile, insinuating manner! It makes you
      feel as if he were plotting your assassination,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;His voice&mdash;ugh!
      It&rsquo;s exactly like lukewarm oil. He makes my flesh creep, like some
      frightful, bloated reptile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a Queen in Thule,&rdquo; hummed Florimond, &ldquo;who had a marvellous
      command of invective. &rsquo;Eaving help your reputation, if you fell under her
      illustrious displeasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you make fun of me. I&rsquo;m sure you think as I do&mdash;that
      he&rsquo;s a monster of low cunning, and cynicism, and craft, and treachery, and
      everything that&rsquo;s vile and revolting. Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; the Queen demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I do, ma&rsquo;am. I think he&rsquo;s a bold, bad, dreadful person. I lie
      awake half the night, counting up his iniquities in my mind. And if just
      now I laughed, it was only to keep from crying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This sort of talk is all very well,&rdquo; put in the King; &ldquo;but the fact
      remains that Tsargradev is the master of Monterosso. He could do any one
      of us an evil turn at any moment. He could cut down our Civil List
      to-morrow, or even send us packing, and establish republic. We&rsquo;re
      dependent for everything upon his pleasure. I think, really, my dear, you
      ought to try to be decent to him&mdash;if only for prudence&rsquo; sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decent to him!&rdquo; echoed her Majesty. &ldquo;I like that! As if I didn&rsquo;t treat
      him a hundred million times better than he deserves! I hope he can&rsquo;t
      complain that I&rsquo;m not decent to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not exactly effusive, do you think? I don&rsquo;t mean that you stick
      your tongue out at him, or throw things at his head. But trust him for
      understanding. It&rsquo;s what you leave unsaid and undone, rather than what you
      say or do. He&rsquo;s fully conscious of the sort of place he occupies in your
      esteem, and he resents it. He thinks you distrust him, suspect him, look
      down upon him....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and so I do,&rdquo; interrupted the Queen. &ldquo;And so do you. And so does
      everybody who has any right feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but those of us who are wise in our generation keep our private
      sentiments regarding him under lock and key. We remember his power, and
      treat him respectfully to his face, however much we may despise him in
      secret. What&rsquo;s the use of quarrelling with our bread and butter? We should
      seek to propitiate him, to rub him the right way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you would actually like me to <i>grovel</i>, to <i>toady</i>, to a
      disgusting little low-born, black-hearted cad like Tsargradev!&rdquo; cried the
      Queen, with scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear me, no,&rdquo; protested her husband. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s a vast difference
      between toadying, and being a little tactful, a little diplomatic. I
      should like you to treat him with something more than bare civility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what can I do that I don&rsquo;t do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never ask him to any but your general public functions, your State
      receptions, and that sort of thing. Why don&rsquo;t you admit him to your
      private circle sometimes? Why don&rsquo;t you invite him to your private
      parties, your dinners?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, merci, non! My private parties are my private parties. I ask my
      friends, I ask the people I like. Nothing could induce me to ask that
      horrid little underbred mongrel creature. He&rsquo;d be&mdash;he&rsquo;d be like&mdash;like
      something unclean&mdash;something murky and contaminating&mdash;in the
      room. He&rsquo;d be like an animal, an ape, a satyr.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; the King submitted meekly, &ldquo;I only hope we&rsquo;ll never have
      cause to repent your exclusion of him. I know he bears us a grudge for it,
      and he&rsquo;s not a person whose grudges are to be made light of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! I&rsquo;m not afraid of him,&rdquo; Anéli retorted. &ldquo;I know he hates me. I see
      it every time he looks at me, with his snaky little eyes, his forced
      little smile&mdash;that awful, complacent, ingratiating smirk of his, that
      shows his teeth, and isn&rsquo;t even skin deep; a mere film spread over his
      face, like pomatum! Oh, I know he hates me. But it&rsquo;s the nature of mean,
      false little beasts like him to hate their betters; so it can&rsquo;t be helped.
      For the rest, he may do his worst. I&rsquo;m not afraid,&rdquo; she concluded airily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only would she take no steps to propitiate M. Tsargradev, but she was
      constantly urging her husband to dismiss him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly certain he has all sorts of dreadful secret vices. I
      haven&rsquo;t the least doubt he&rsquo;s murdered people. I&rsquo;m sure he steals. I&rsquo;m sure
      he has a secret understanding with Berlin, and accepts bribes to manage
      the affairs of Monterosso as Prince Bismarck wishes. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re more
      or less in disgrace with our natural allies, Russia and France. Because
      Tsargradev is paid to pursue, an anti-Russian, a German, policy. If you
      would take my advice, you&rsquo;d dismiss him, and have him put in prison. Then
      you could explain to the Soviete that he is a murderer, a thief, a
      traitor, and a monster of secret immorality, and appoint a decent person
      in his place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband laughed with great amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t appear quite yet to have mastered the principles of
      constitutional government, my dear. I could no more dismiss Tsargradev
      than you could dismiss the Pope of Rome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you or are you not the King of Monterosso?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Vice-King, perhaps. You&rsquo;re the King, you know. But that has nothing
      to do with it. Tsargradev is leader of the Soviete. The Soviete pays the
      bills, and its leader governs. The King&rsquo;s a mere fifth wheel. Some day
      they&rsquo;ll abolish him. Meanwhile they tolerate him, on the understanding
      that he&rsquo;s not to interfere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to be ashamed to say so. You ought to take the law and the
      Constitution and everything into your own hands. If you asserted yourself,
      they&rsquo;d never dare to resist you. But you always submit&mdash;submit&mdash;submit.
      Of course, everybody takes advantage of a man who always submits. Show
      that you have some spirit, some sense of your own dignity. Order
      Tsargradev&rsquo;s dismissal and arrest. You can do it now, at once, this
      evening. Then to-morrow you can go down to the Soviete, and tell them what
      a scoundrel he is&mdash;a thief, a murderer, a traitor, an impostor, a
      libertine, everything that&rsquo;s foul and bad. And tell them that henceforward
      you intend to be really King, and not merely nominally King; and that
      you&rsquo;re going to govern exactly as you think best; and that, if they don&rsquo;t
      like that, they will have to make the best of it. If they resist, you can
      dissolve them, and order a general election. Or you can suspend the
      Constitution, and govern without any Soviete at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The King laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid the Soviete might ask for a little evidence, a few proofs, in
      support of my sweeping charges. I could hardly satisfy them by declaring
      that I had my wife&rsquo;s word for it. But, seriously, you exaggerate.
      Tsargradev is anything you like from the point of view of abstract ethics,
      but he&rsquo;s not a criminal. He hasn&rsquo;t the faintest motive for doing anything
      that isn&rsquo;t in accordance with the law. He&rsquo;s simply a vulgar, self-seeking
      politician, with a touch of the Tartar. But he&rsquo;s not a thief, and I
      imagine his private life is no worse than most men&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, wait, only wait!&rdquo; cried the Queen. &ldquo;Time will show. Some day he&rsquo;ll
      come to grief, and then you&rsquo;ll see that he&rsquo;s even worse than I have said.
      I <i>feel</i>, I <i>know</i>, he&rsquo;s everything that&rsquo;s bad. Trust a woman&rsquo;s
      intuitions. They&rsquo;re much better than what you call <i>evidence</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she had a nickname for him, which, as well as her general criticisms
      of his character, had pretty certainly reached the Premier&rsquo;s ear; for, as
      subsequent events demonstrated, very nearly every servant in the Palace
      was a spy in his pay. She called him the nain jaune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subsequent events have also demonstrated that her woman&rsquo;s intuitions were
      indeed trustworthy. Perhaps you will remember the revelations that were
      made at the time of M. Tsargradev&rsquo;s downfall; fairly full reports of them
      appeared in the London papers. Murder, peculation, and revolting secret
      debaucheries were all, surely enough, proved against him. It was proved
      that he was the paid agent of Berlin; it was proved that he had had
      recourse to <i>torture</i> in dealing with certain refractory witnesses in
      his famous prosecution of Count Osaréki. And then, there was the case of
      Colonel Alexandrevitch. He and Tsargradev, at sunset, were strolling
      arm-in-arm in the Dunayskiy Prospekt, when the Colonel was shot by some
      person concealed in the shrubberies, who was never captured. Tsargradev
      and his friends broached the theory, which gained pretty general
      acceptance, that the shot had been intended for the Prime Minister
      himself, and that the death of Colonel Alexandrevitch was an accident due
      to bad aiming. It is now perfectly well established that the death of the
      Colonel was due to very good aiming indeed; that the assassin was M.
      Tsargradev&rsquo;s own hireling; and that perhaps the best reason why the police
      could never lay hands on him had some connection with the circumstance
      that the poor wretch, that very night, was strangled and cast into the
      Danube.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, they manage these things in a highly unlikely and theatrical manner,
      in the far south-east of Europe!
    </p>
    <p>
      But the particular circumstances of M. Tsargradev&rsquo;s downfall were
      amusingly illustrative of the character of the Queen. <i>Ce que femme
      veult, Dieu le veult.</i> And though her husband talked of the
      Constitution, and pleaded the necessity of evidence, Anéli was
      unconvinced. To get rid of Tsargradev, by one method or another, was her
      fixed idea, her determined purpose; she bided her time, and in the end she
      accomplished it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It befell, during the seventh month of my stay in the Palace, that a
      certain great royal wedding was appointed to be celebrated at Dresden: a
      festivity to which were bidden all the crowned heads and most of the royal
      and semi-royal personages of Christendom, and amongst them the Krol and
      Kroleva of Monte-rosso.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will cost us a pretty sum of money,&rdquo; Theodore grumbled, when the
      summons first reached him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to travel in state, with a full
      suite; and the whole shot must be paid from our private purse. There&rsquo;s no
      expecting a penny for such a purpose from the Soviete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; exclaimed the Queen, looking up from a letter she was writing,
      &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t for a moment intend to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We <i>must</i> go,&rdquo; answered the King. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no getting out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll send a representative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wish we could,&rdquo; sighed the King. &ldquo;But unfortunately this is an
      occasion when etiquette requires that we should attend in person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bother etiquette,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Etiquette was made for slaves. We&rsquo;ll
      send your Cousin Peter. One must find some use for one&rsquo;s Cousin Peters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but this is a business, alas, in which one&rsquo;s Cousin Peter won&rsquo;t go
      down. I&rsquo;m very sorry to say we&rsquo;ll have to attend in person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Attend in person! How can you think of such a
      thing? We&rsquo;d be bored and fatigued to death. It will be unspeakable.
      Nothing but dull, stodgy, suffocating German pomposity and bad taste. Oh,
      je m&rsquo;y connais! Red cloth, and military bands, and interminable banquets,
      and noise, and confusion, and speeches (oh, the speeches!), until you&rsquo;re
      ready to drop. And besides, we&rsquo;d be herded with a crowd of ninth-rate
      princelings and petty dukes, who smell of beer and cabbage and
      brilliantine. We&rsquo;d be relegated to the fifth or sixth rank, behind people
      who are all of them really our inferiors. Do you suppose I mean to let
      myself be patronised by a lot of stupid Hohenzollerns and Grâtzhoffens?
      No, indeed! You can send your Cousin Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear, if I were the Tsar of Russia!&rdquo; laughed her husband. &ldquo;Then I
      could send a present and a poor relation, and all would be well. But&mdash;you
      speak of ninth-rate princelings. A ninth-rate princeling like the Krol of
      Tchermnogoria must make act of presence in his proper skin. It&rsquo;s <i>de
      rigueur</i>. There&rsquo;s no getting out of it. We must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, <i>you</i> may go, if you like,&rdquo; her Majesty declared. &ldquo;As for me,
      I <i>won&rsquo;t</i>. If <i>you</i> choose to go and be patronised and bored,
      and half killed by the fatigue, and half ruined by the expense, I suppose
      I can&rsquo;t prevent you. But, if you want my opinion, I think it&rsquo;s utter
      insane folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she re-absorbed herself in her letter, with the air of one who had
      been distracted for a moment by a frivolous and tiresome interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King did not press the matter that evening, but the next morning he
      mustered his courage, and returned to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I beg you to listen to me patiently for a moment,
      and not get angry. What I wish to say is really very important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is it? What is it?&rdquo; she enquired, with anticipatory weariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about going to Dresden. I&mdash;I want to assure you that I dislike
      the notion of going quite as much as you can. But it&rsquo;s no question of
      choice. There are certain things one has to do, whether one will or not.
      I&rsquo;m exceedingly sorry to have to insist, but we positively must reconcile
      ourselves to the sacrifice, and attend the wedding&mdash;both of us. It&rsquo;s
      a necessity of our position. If we should stay away, it would be a breach
      of international good manners that people would never forgive us. We
      should be the scandal, the by-word, of the Courts of Europe. We&rsquo;d give the
      direst offence in twenty different quarters. We really can&rsquo;t afford to
      make enemies of half the royal families of the civilised world. You can&rsquo;t
      imagine the unpleasantnesses, the complications, our absence would store
      up for us; the bad blood it would cause. We&rsquo;d be put in the black list of
      our order, and snubbed, and embarrassed, and practically ostracised, for
      years to come. And you know whether we need friends. But the case is so
      obvious, it seems a waste of breath to argue it. You surely won&rsquo;t let a
      mere little matter of temporary personal inconvenience get us into such an
      ocean of hot water. Come now&mdash;be reasonable, and say you will go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Queen&rsquo;s eyes were burning; her under-lip had swollen portentously; but
      she did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King waited a moment. Then, &ldquo;Come, Anéli&mdash;don&rsquo;t be angry. Answer
      me. Say that you will go,&rdquo; he urged, taking her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She snatched her hand away. I&rsquo;m afraid she stamped her foot. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she
      cried. &ldquo;Let me alone. I tell you I <i>won&rsquo;t.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear....&rdquo; the King was re-commencing....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no! And you needn&rsquo;t call me your dear. If you had the least love
      for me, the least common kindness, or consideration for my health or
      comfort or happiness, you&rsquo;d never dream of proposing such a thing. To drag
      me half-way across the Continent of Europe, to be all but killed at the
      end of the journey by a pack of horrid, coarse, beer-drinking Germans! And
      tired out, and irritated, and patronised, and humiliated by people like
      &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;! It&rsquo;s
      perfectly heartless of you. And I&mdash;when I suggest such a simple
      natural pleasure as a trip to Paris, or to the Italian lakes in autumn&mdash;you
      tell me we can&rsquo;t afford it! You&rsquo;re ready to spend thousands on a stupid,
      utterly unnecessary and futile absurdity, like this wedding, but you can&rsquo;t
      afford to take me to the Italian lakes! And yet you pretend to love me!
      Oh, its awful, awful, awful!&rdquo; And her voice failed her in a sob; and she
      hid her face in her hands, and wept. So the King had to drop the subject
      again, and to devote his talents to the task of drying her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t know how many times they renewed the discussion, but I do know
      that the Queen stood firm in her original refusal, and that at last it was
      decided that the King should go without her, and excuse her absence as
      best he might on the plea of her precarious state of health. It was only
      after this resolution was made and registered, and her husband had brought
      himself to accept it with some degree of resignation&mdash;it was only
      then that her Majesty began to waver and vacillate, and reconsider, and
      change her mind. As the date approached for his departure, her
      alternations became an affair of hours. It was, &ldquo;Oh, after all, I can&rsquo;t
      let you go alone, poor Theo. And besides, I should die of heartbreak, here
      without you. So&mdash;there&mdash;I&rsquo;ll make the best of a bad business,
      and go with you&rdquo;&mdash;it was either that, or else, &ldquo;No, after all, I <i>can&rsquo;t</i>.
      I really can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m awfully sorry. I shall miss you horribly. But, when I
      think of what it <i>means</i>, I haven&rsquo;t the strength or courage. I simply
      can&rsquo;t&rdquo;&mdash;it was one thing or the other, on and off, all day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you finally know your own mind, I shall be glad if you&rsquo;ll send for
      me,&rdquo; said Theodore. &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve got to name a Regent. And if you&rsquo;re
      coming with me, I shall name my Uncle Stephen. But if you&rsquo;re stopping
      here, of course I shall name you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There is a bothersome little provision in the Constitution of Monterosso
      to the effect that the Sovereign may not cross the frontiers of his
      dominions, no matter for how brief a sojourn, without leaving a Regent in
      command. Under the good old régime, before the revolution of 1868, the
      kings of Tchermnogoria were a good deal inclined to spend the bulk of
      their time&mdash;and money&mdash;in foreign parts. They found Paris, Monte
      Carlo, St. Petersburg, Vienna, and even, if you can believe me, sometimes
      London, on the whole more agreeable as places of residence than their
      hereditary capital. (There was the particularly flagrant case of Paul II.,
      our Theodore&rsquo;s great-grandfather, who lived for twenty years on end in
      Rome. He fancied himself a statuary, poor gentleman, and produced&mdash;oh,
      such amazing Groups! Tons of them repose in the Royal Museum at Vescova; a
      few brave the sky here and there in lost corners of the Campagna&mdash;he
      used to present them to the Pope! Perhaps you have seen his Fountain at
      Acqu&rsquo;amarra?) It was to discourage this sort of royal absenteeism that the
      patriotic framers of the Constitution slyly slipped Sub-Clause 18 into
      Clause ii., of Title 3, of Article XXXVI.: <i>Concerning the Appointment
      of a Regent.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Theodore, &ldquo;when you have finally made up your mind, I shall be
      glad if you will let me know; for I&rsquo;ve got to name a Regent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Queen continued to hesitate; in the morning it was Yes, in the
      evening No; and the eleventh hour was drawing near and nearer. The King
      was to leave on Monday. On the previous Tuesday, in a melting mood, Anéli
      had declared, &ldquo;There! Once for all, to make an end of it, I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo; On
      Wednesday a Commission of Regency, appointing Prince Stephen, was drawn
      up. On Thursday it was brought to the Palace for the royal signature. The
      King had actually got so far as the <i>d</i> in his name, when the Queen,
      faltering at sight of the irrevocable document, laid her hand on his arm.
      She was very pale, and her voice was weak. &ldquo;No, Theo, don&rsquo;t sign it. It&rsquo;s
      like my death-warrant. I&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t got the courage. You&rsquo;ll have to
      let me stay. You&rsquo;ll have to go alone.&rdquo; On Friday a new commission was
      prepared, in which Anéli&rsquo;s name had been substituted for Stephen&rsquo;s. On
      Saturday morning it was presented to the King. &ldquo;Shall I sign?&rdquo; he asked.
      &ldquo;Yes, sign,&rdquo; said she. And he signed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ouf!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s</i> settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she hardly once changed her mind again until Sunday night; and even
      then she only half changed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it weren&rsquo;t too late,&rdquo; she announced, &ldquo;do you know, I believe I&rsquo;d
      decide to go with you, in spite of everything? But of course I never could
      get ready to start by to-morrow morning. You couldn&rsquo;t wait till Tuesday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The King said he couldn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, my dears&rdquo; (as Florimond, who loves to tell the story, is wont to
      begin it), &ldquo;no sooner was her poor confiding husband&rsquo;s back a-turned, than
      what do you suppose this deep, designing, unprincipled, high-handed young
      woman up and did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Almost the last words Theodore spoke to her were, &ldquo;Do, for heaven&rsquo;s sake,
      try to get on pleasantly with Tsargradev. Don&rsquo;t treat him too much as if
      he were the dust under your feet. All you&rsquo;ll have to do is to sign your
      name at the end of the papers he&rsquo;ll bring you. Sign and ask no questions,
      and all will be well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the very first act of Anéli&rsquo;s Regency was to degrade M. Tsargardev
      from office and to place him under arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      We bade the King good-bye on the deck of the royal yacht <i>Nemisa</i>,
      which was to bear him to Belgrade, the first stage of his journey. Cannon
      bellowed from the citadel; the bells of all the churches in the town were
      clanging in jubilant discord; the river was gay with fluttering bunting,
      and the King resplendent in a gold-laced uniform, with the stars and
      crosses of I don&rsquo;t know how many Orders glittering on his breast. We
      lingered at the landing-stage, waving our pocket-handkerchiefs, till the
      <i>Nemisa</i> turned a promontory and disappeared; Anéli silent, with a
      white face, and set, wistful eyes. And then we got into a great
      gilt-and-scarlet state-coach, she and Madame Donarowska, Florimond and I,
      and were driven back to the Palace; and during the drive she never once
      spoke, but leaned her cheek on Madame Donarowska&rsquo;s shoulder, and cried as
      if her heart would break.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Palace reached, however&mdash;as who should say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not here to
      amuse ourselves&rdquo;&mdash;she promptly dried her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what I&rsquo;m going to do?&rdquo; she asked. And, on our admitting that
      we didn&rsquo;t, she continued, blithely, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an ill wind that blows no good.
      Theo&rsquo;s absence will be very hard to bear, but I must turn it to some
      profitable account. I must improve the occasion to straighten out his
      affairs; I must put his house in order. I&rsquo;m going to give Monsieur
      Tsargradev a taste of retributive justice. I&rsquo;m going to do what Theo
      himself ought to have done long ago. It&rsquo;s intolerable that a miscreant
      like Tsargradev should remain at large in a civilised country; it&rsquo;s a
      disgrace to humanity that such a man should hold honourable office. I&rsquo;m
      going to dismiss him and put him in prison. And I shall keep him there
      till a thorough investigation has been made of his official acts, and the
      crimes I&rsquo;m perfectly certain he&rsquo;s committed have been proved against him.
      I&rsquo;m not going to be Regent for nothing. I&rsquo;m going to <i>rule</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We, her auditors, looked at each other in consternation. It was a good
      minute before either of us could collect himself sufficiently to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, &ldquo;Oh, lady, lady, august and gracious lady,&rdquo; groaned Florimond,
      &ldquo;please be nice, and relieve our minds by confessing that you&rsquo;re only
      saying it to tease us. Tell us you&rsquo;re only joking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never was more serious in my life,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I defy you to look me in the eye and say so without laughing,&rdquo; he
      persisted. &ldquo;What <i>is</i> the fun of trying to frighten us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be frightened. I know what I&rsquo;m about,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you&rsquo;re about!&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;Oh me, oh my! You&rsquo;re about to bring your
      house crashing round your ears. You&rsquo;re about to precipitate a revolution.
      You&rsquo;ll lose your poor unfortunate husband&rsquo;s kingdom for him. You&rsquo;ll&mdash;goodness
      only can tell what you <i>won&rsquo;t</i> do. Your own bodily safety&mdash;your
      very life&mdash;will be in danger. There&rsquo;ll be mobs, there&rsquo;ll be rioting.
      Oh, lady, sweet lady, gentle lady, you mustn&rsquo;t, you really mustn&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;d
      much better come and sing a song, along o&rsquo; me. Don&rsquo;t meddle with politics.
      They&rsquo;re nothing but sea, sand, and folly. Music&rsquo;s the only serious thing
      in the world. Come&mdash;let&rsquo;s too-tootle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well to try to turn what I say to jest,&rdquo; the Queen replied
      loftily, &ldquo;but I assure you I mean every word of it. I&rsquo;ve studied the
      Constitution. I know my rights. The appointment and revocation of
      Ministers rest absolutely with the Sovereign. It&rsquo;s not a matter of law,
      it&rsquo;s merely a matter of custom, a matter of convenience, that the
      Ministers should be chosen from the party that has a majority in the
      Soviete. Well, when it comes to the case of a ruffian like Tsargradev,
      custom and convenience must go by the board, in favour of right and
      justice. I&rsquo;m going to revoke him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And within an hour of your doing so the whole town of Vescova will be in
      revolt. We&rsquo;ll all have to leave the Palace, and fly for our precious
      skins. We&rsquo;ll be lucky if we get away with them intact. A pretty piece of
      business! Tsargradev, from being Grand Vizier, will become Grand Mogul;
      and farewell to the illustrious dynasty of Pavelovitch! Oh, lady, lady! I
      call it downright unfriendly, downright inhospitable of you. Where shall
      my grey hairs find shelter? I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> comfortable here under your
      royal rooftree. You wouldn&rsquo;t deprive the gentlest of God&rsquo;s creatures of a
      happy home? Better that a thousand Tsargradevs should flourish like a
      green bay-tree, than that one upright man should be turned out of
      comfortable quarters. There, now, be kind. As a personal favour to me,
      won&rsquo;t you please just leave things as they are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Queen laughed a little&mdash;not very heartily, though, and not at all
      acquiescently. &ldquo;Monsieur Tsargradev must go to prison,&rdquo; was her inexorable
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      We pleaded, we argued, we exhausted ourselves in warnings and
      protestations, but to no purpose. And in the end she lost her patience,
      and shut us up categorically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Laissez moi tranquille!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard enough. I know my own
      mind. I won&rsquo;t be bothered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was with heavy spirits and the dismallest forebodings that we assisted
      at her subsequent proceedings. We had an anxious time of it for many days;
      and it has never ceased to be a source of astonishment to me that it all
      turned out as well as it did. But&mdash;<i>ce que femme veult</i>....
    </p>
    <p>
      She began operations by despatching an aide-decamp to M. Tsargradev&rsquo;s
      house, with a note in which she commanded him to wait upon her forthwith
      at the Palace, and to deliver up his seals of office.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time she summoned to her presence General Michaïlov, the
      Military Governor of Vescova, and Prince Vasiliev, the leader of the scant
      Conservative opposition in the Soviete.
    </p>
    <p>
      She awaited these gentleman in the throne-room, surrounded by the officers
      of the household in full uniform. Florimond and I hovered uneasily in the
      background.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, she does look her part, doesn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Florimond whispered to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wore a robe of black silk, with the yellow ribbon of the Lion of
      Monterosso across her breast, and a tiara of diamonds in her hair. Her
      eyes glowed with a fire of determination, and her cheeks with a colour
      that those who knew her recognised for a danger-signal. She stood on the
      steps of the throne, waiting, and tapping nervously with her foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the great white-and-gold folding doors were thrown open, and M.
      Tsargradev entered, followed by the aide-de-camp who had gone to fetch
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered, bowing and smiling, grotesque in his ministerial green and
      silver; and the top of his bald head shone as if it had been waxed and
      polished. Bowing and smirking, he advanced to the foot of the throne,
      where he halted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have sent for you to demand the return of your seals of office,&rdquo; said
      the Queen. She held her head high, and spoke slowly, with superb
      haughtiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tsargradev bowed low, and, always smiling, answered, in a voice of honey,
      &ldquo;If it please your Majesty, I don&rsquo;t think I quite understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have sent for you to demand the return of your seals of office,&rdquo; the
      Queen repeated, her head higher, her inflection haughtier than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your Majesty mean that I am to consider myself dismissed from her
      service?&rdquo; he asked, with undiminished sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my desire that you should deliver up your seals of office,&rdquo; said
      she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tsargradev&rsquo;s lips puckered in an effort to suppress a little good-humoured
      deprecatory laugh. &ldquo;But, your Majesty,&rdquo; he protested, in the tone of one
      reasoning with a wayward school-girl, &ldquo;you must surely know that you have
      no power to dismiss a constitutional Minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must decline to hold any discussion with you. I must insist upon the
      immediate surrender of your seals of office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must remind your Majesty that I am the representative of the majority
      of the Soviete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forbid you to answer me. I forbid you to speak in my presence. You are
      not here to speak. You are here to restore the seals of your office to
      your Sovereign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, your Majesty, I must, with all respect, decline to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You refuse?&rdquo; the Queen demanded, with terrific shortness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot admit your Majesty&rsquo;s right to demand such a thing of me. It is
      unconstitutional.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words, you refuse to obey my commands? Colonel Karkov!&rdquo; she
      called.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were burning magnificently now; her hands trembled a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Karkov, the Marshal of the Palace, stepped forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrest that man,&rdquo; said the Queen, pointing to Tsargradev.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Karkov looked doubtful, hesitant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you also mean to disobey me?&rdquo; the Queen cried, with a glance... oh, a
      glance!
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Karkov turned pale, but he hesitated no longer. He bowed to
      Tsargradev. &ldquo;I must ask you to constitute yourself my prisoner,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tsargradev made a motion as if to speak; but the Queen raised her hand,
      and he was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take him away at once,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Lock him up. He is to be absolutely
      prevented from holding any communication with any one outside the Palace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, somehow, Colonel Karkov managed to lead Tsargradev from the
      presence-chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that ended the first act of our comical, precarious little melodrama.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Tsargradev&rsquo;s departure there was a sudden buzz of conversation among
      the courtiers. The Queen sank back, in evident exhaustion, upon the red
      velvet cushions of the throne. She closed her eyes and breathed deeply,
      holding one of her hands pressed hard against her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by she looked up. She was very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now let General Michaïlov and Prince Vasiliev be introduced,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when they stood before her, &ldquo;General Michaïlov,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;I desire
      you to place the town of Vescova under martial law. You will station
      troops about the Palace, about the Chamber of the Soviete, about the Mint
      and Government offices, and in all open squares and other places where
      crowds would be likely to collect. I have just dismissed M. Tsargradev
      from office, and there may be some disturbance. You will rigorously
      suppress any signs of disorder. I shall hold you responsible for the peace
      of the town and the protection of my person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      General Michaïlov, a short, stout, purple-faced old soldier, blinked and
      coughed, and was presumably on the point of offering something in the
      nature of an objection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard my wishes,&rdquo; said the Queen. &ldquo;I shall be glad if you will
      see to their immediate execution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General still seemed to have something on his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen stamped her foot. &ldquo;Is everybody in a conspiracy to disobey me?&rdquo;
       she demanded. &ldquo;I am the representative of your King, who is
      Commander-in-Chief of the Army. Are my orders to be questioned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General bowed, and backed from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince Vasiliev,&rdquo; the Queen said, &ldquo;I have sent for you to ask you to
      replace M. Tsargradev as Secretary of State for the Interior, and
      President of the Council. You will at once enter into the discharge of
      your duties, and proceed to the formation of a Ministry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prince Vasiliev was a tall, spare, faded old man, with a pointed face
      ending in a white imperial. He was a great personal favourite of the
      Queen&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a little difficult, Madame,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; assented she. &ldquo;But it must be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly see, Madame, how I can form a Ministry to any purpose, with an
      overwhelming majority against me in the Soviete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are to dissolve the Soviete and order a general election.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The general election can scarcely be expected to result in a change of
      parties, your Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but we shall have gained time. When the new deputies are ready to
      take their seats, M. Tsargradev&rsquo;s case will have been disposed of. I
      expect you will find among his papers at the Home Office evidence
      sufficient to convict him of all sorts of crimes. If I can deliver
      Monterosso from the Tsargradev superstition, my intention will have been
      accomplished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s lunch,&rdquo; she said to Florimond and me, at the close of this
      historic session. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ravenously hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I dare say General Michaïlov did what he could, but his troops weren&rsquo;t
      numerous enough to prevent a good deal of disturbance in the town; and I
      suppose he didn&rsquo;t want to come to bloodshed. For three days and nights,
      the streets leading up to the Palace were black with a howling mob, kept
      from crossing the Palace courtyard by a guard of only about a hundred men.
      Cries of &ldquo;Long live Tsargradev!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Death to the German woman!&rdquo; and
      worse cries still, were constantly audible from the Palace windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Canaille!&rdquo; exclaimed the Queen. &ldquo;Let them shout themselves hoarse. Time
      will show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she would step out upon her balcony, in full sight of the enemy, and
      look down upon them calmly, contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, the military did contrive to prevent an actual revolution, and to
      maintain the <i>status quo</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news reached the King at Vienna. He turned straight round and hurried
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear, my dear!&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;You <i>have</i> made a mess of
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so? Read this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a copy of the morning&rsquo;s Gazette, containing Prince Vasiliev&rsquo;s
      report of the interesting discoveries he had made amongst the papers
      Tsargradev had left behind him at the Home Office.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an immediate revulsion of public feeling. The secret
      understanding with Berlin was the thing that &ldquo;did it.&rdquo; The Monterossans
      are hereditarily, temperamentally, and from motives of policy, Russophils.
    </p>
    <p>
      They couldn&rsquo;t forgive Tsargradev his secret treaty with Berlin; and they
      promptly proceeded to execrate him as much as they had loved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For State reasons, however, it was decided not to prosecute him. On his
      release from prison, he asked for his passport, that he might go abroad.
      He has remained an exile ever since, and (according to Florimond, at any
      rate) &ldquo;is spending his declining years colouring a meerschaum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People talk of the ingratitude of princes,&rdquo; said the Queen, last night.
      &ldquo;But what of the ingratitude of nations? The Monterossans hated me because
      I dismissed M. Tsargradev; and then, when they saw him revealed in his
      true colours, they still hated me, in spite of it. They are quick to
      resent what they imagine to be an injury; but they never recognise a
      benefit. Oh, the folly of universal suffrage! The folly of constitutional
      government! I used to say, &rsquo;Surely a good despot is better than a mob.&rsquo;
      But now I&rsquo;m convinced that a <i>bad</i> despot, even, is better. Come,
      Florimond, let us sing.... you know.... that song....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God save&mdash;the best of despots?&rdquo; suggested Florimond.

      COUSIN ROSALYS

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>sn&rsquo;t it a pretty
      name, Rosalys? But, for me, it is so much more; it is a sort of romantic
      symbol. I look at it written there on the page, and the sentiment of
      things changes: it is as if I were listening to distant music; it is as if
      the white paper turned softly pink, and breathed a perfume&mdash;never so
      faint a perfume of hyacinths. Rosalys, Cousin Rosalys.... London and this
      sad-coloured February morning become shadowy, remote. I think of another
      world, another era. Somebody has said that old memories and fond regrets
      are the day-dreams of the disappointed, the illusions of the age of
      disillusion. Well, if they are illusions, thank goodness they are where
      experience can&rsquo;t touch them&mdash;on the safe side of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Cousin Rosalys&mdash;I call her cousin. But, as we often used to remind
      ourselves, with a kind of esoteric satisfaction, we were not &ldquo;real&rdquo;
       cousins. She was the niece of my Aunt Elizabeth, and lived with her in
      Rome; but my Aunt Elizabeth was not my &ldquo;real&rdquo; aunt&mdash;only my
      great-aunt by marriage, the widow of my father&rsquo;s uncle. It was Aunt
      Elizabeth herself however, who dubbed us cousins, when she introduced us
      to each other; and at that epoch, for both of us, Aunt Elizabeth&rsquo;s
      lightest words were in the nature of decrees, she was such a terrible old
      lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know why she was terrible, I don&rsquo;t know how she contrived
      it; she never said anything, never did anything, especially terrifying;
      she wasn&rsquo;t especially wise or especially witty&mdash;intellectually,
      indeed, I suspect she might have passed for a paragon of respectable
      commonplaceness: but I do know that everybody stood in awe of her. I
      suppose it must simply have been her atmosphere, her odylic force; a sort
      of metaphysical chill that enveloped her, and was felt by all who
      approached her&mdash;some people <i>are</i> like that. Everybody stood in
      awe of her, everybody deferred to her: relations, friends, even her
      Director, and the cloud of priests that pervaded her establishment and
      gave it its character. For, like so many other old ladies who lived in
      Rome in those days, my Aunt Elizabeth was nothing if not Catholic, if not
      Ecclesiastical. You would have guessed as much, I think, from her
      exterior. She <i>looked</i> Catholic, she <i>looked</i> Ecclesiastical.
      There was something Gothic in her anatomy, in the architecture of her
      face: in her high-bridged nose, in the pointed arch her hair made as it
      parted above her forehead, in her prominent cheek-bones, her
      straight-lipped mouth and long attenuated chin, in the angularities of her
      figure. No doubt the simile must appear far-sought, but upon my word her
      face used to remind me of a chapel&mdash;a chapel built of marble, fallen
      somewhat into decay. I&rsquo;m not sure whether she was a tall woman, or whether
      she only had a false air of tallness, being excessively thin and holding
      herself rigidly erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      She always dressed in black, in hard black silk cut to the severest
      patterns. Somehow, the very jewels she wore&mdash;not merely the cross on
      her bosom, but the rings on her fingers, the watch-chain round her neck,
      her watch itself, her old-fashioned, gold-faced watch&mdash;seemed of a
      mode canonical.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was nothing if not Catholic, if not Ecclesiastical; but I don&rsquo;t in the
      least mean that she was particularly devout. She observed all requisite
      forms, of course: went, as occasion demanded, to mass, to vespers, to
      confession; but religious fervour was the last thing she suggested, the
      last thing she affected. I never heard her talk of Faith or Salvation, of
      Sin or Grace, nor indeed of any matters spiritual. She was quite frankly a
      woman of the world, and it was the Church as a worldly institution, the
      Church corporal, the Papacy, Papal politics, that absorbed her interests.
      The loss of the Temporal Power was the wrong that filled the universe for
      her, its restoration the cause for which she lived. That it was a forlorn
      cause she would never for an instant even hypothetically admit. &ldquo;Remember
      Avignon, remember the Seventy Years,&rdquo; she used to say, with a nod that
      seemed to attribute apodictic value to the injunction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mark my words, she&rsquo;ll live to be Pope yet,&rdquo; a ribald young man murmured
      behind her chair. &ldquo;Oh, you tell me she is a woman. I&rsquo;ll assume it for the
      sake of the argument&mdash;I&rsquo;d do anything for the sake of an argument.
      But remember Joan, remember Pope Joan!&rdquo; And he mimicked his Aunt
      Elizabeth&rsquo;s inflection and her conclusive nod.

      I had not been in Rome since that universe-filling wrong was perpetrated&mdash;not
      since I was a child of six or seven&mdash;when, a youth approaching
      twenty, I went there in the autumn of 1879; and I recollected Aunt
      Elizabeth only vaguely, as a lady with a face like a chapel, in whose
      presence&mdash;I had almost written in whose precincts&mdash;it had
      required some courage to breathe. But my mother&rsquo;s last words, when I left
      her in Paris, had been, &ldquo;Now mind you call on your Aunt Elizabeth at once.
      You mustn&rsquo;t let a day pass. I am writing to her to tell her that you are
      coming. She will expect you to call at once.&rdquo; So, on the morrow of my
      arrival, I made an exceedingly careful toilet (I remember to this day the
      pains I bestowed upon my tie, the revisions to which I submitted it!),
      and, with an anxious heart, presented myself at the huge brown Roman
      palace, a portion of which my formidable relative inhabited; a palace with
      grated windows, and a vaulted, crypt-like porte-cochère, and a tremendous
      Swiss concierge, in knee-breeches and a cocked hat: the Palazzo
      Zacchinelli.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Swiss, flourishing his staff of office, marshalled me (I can&rsquo;t use a
      less imposing word for the ceremony) slowly, solemnly, across a courtyard,
      and up a great stone staircase, at the top of which he handed me on to a
      functionary in black&mdash;a functionary with an ominously austere
      countenance, like an usher to the Inquisition. Poor old Archimede! Later,
      when I had come to know him well and tip him, I found he was the mildest
      creature, the amiablest, the most obliging, and that tenebrious mien of
      his only a congenital accident, like a lisp or a club-foot. But for the
      present he dismayed me, and I surrendered myself with humility and
      meekness to his guardianship. He conducted me through a series of vast
      chambers&mdash;you know those enormous, ungenial Roman rooms, their sombre
      tapestried walls, their formal furniture, their cheerless, perpetual
      twilight&mdash;and out upon a terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terrace lay in full sunshine. There was a garden below it, a garden
      with orange-trees, and rosebushes, and camellias, with stretches of
      greensward, with shrubberies, with a great fountain plashing in the midst
      of it, and broken, moss-grown statues: a Roman garden, from which a
      hundred sweet airs came up, in the gentle Roman weather. The balustrade of
      the terrace was set at intervals with flowering plants, in big urn-shaped
      vases; I don&rsquo;t remember what the flowers were, but they were pink, and
      many of their petals had fallen, and lay scattered on the grey terrace
      pavement. At the far end, under an awning brave with red and yellow
      stripes, two ladies were seated&mdash;a lady in black, presumably the
      object of my pious pilgrimage; and a lady in white, whom, even from a
      distance, I discovered to be young and pretty. A little round table stood
      between them, with a carafe of water and some tumblers glistening crisply
      on it. The lady in black was fanning herself with a black lace fan. The
      lady in white held a book in her hand, from which I think she had been
      reading aloud. A tiny imp of a red Pomeranian dog had started forward, and
      was barking furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      This scene must have made a deeper impression upon my perceptions than any
      that I was conscious of at the moment, because it has always remained as
      fresh in my memory as you see it now. It has always been a picture that I
      could turn to when I would, and find unfaded: the garden, the blue sky,
      the warm September sunshine, the long terrace, and the two ladies seated
      at the end of it, looking towards me, an elderly lady in black, and a
      young lady in white, with dark hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      My aunt quieted Sandro (that was the dog&rsquo;s name), and giving me her hand,
      said &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; rather drily. And then, for what seemed a terribly
      long time, though no doubt it was only a few seconds, she kept me standing
      before her, while she scrutinised me through a double eye-glass, which she
      held by a mother-of-pearl handle; and I was acutely aware of the awkward
      figure I must be cutting to the vision of that strange young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, &ldquo;I should never have recognised you. As a child you were the
      image of your father. Now you resemble your mother,&rdquo; Aunt Elizabeth
      declared; and lowering her glass, she added, &ldquo;This is your cousin
      Rosalys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wondered, as I made my bow, why I had never heard before that I had such
      a pretty cousin, with such a pretty name. She smiled on me very kindly,
      and I noticed how bright her eyes were, and how white and delicate her
      face. The little blue veins showed through the skin, and there was no more
      than just the palest, palest thought of colour in her cheeks. But her lips&mdash;exquisitely
      curved, sensitive lips&mdash;were warm red. She smiled on me very kindly,
      and I daresay my heart responded with an instant palpitation. She was a
      girl, and she was pretty; and her name was Rosalys; and we were cousins;
      and I was eighteen. And above us glowed the blue sky of Italy, and round
      us the golden sunshine; and there, beside the terrace, lay the beautiful
      old Roman garden, the fragrant, romantic garden.... If at eighteen one
      isn&rsquo;t susceptible and sentimental and impetuous, and prepared to respond
      with an instant sweet commotion to the smiles of one&rsquo;s pretty cousins
      (especially when they&rsquo;re named Rosalys), I protest one is unworthy of
      one&rsquo;s youth. One might as well be thirty-five, and a literary hack in
      London.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that introduction, however, my aunt immediately reclaimed my
      attention. She proceeded to ask me all sorts of questions, about myself,
      about my people, uninteresting questions, disconcerting questions, which
      she posed with the air of one who knew the answers beforehand, and was
      only asking as an examiner asks, to test you. And all the while, the
      expression of her face, of her deprecating straight-lipped mouth, of her
      half-closed sceptical old eyes, seemed to imply that she already had her
      opinion of me, and that it wouldn&rsquo;t in the least be affected by anything I
      could say for myself, and that it was distinctly not a flattering opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and what brings you to Rome?&rdquo; That was one of her questions. I felt
      like a suspicious character haled before the local magistrate to give an
      account of his presence in the parish; putting on the best face I could, I
      pleaded superior orders. I had taken my <i>baccalauréat</i> in the summer;
      and my father desired me to pass some months in Italy, for the purpose of
      &ldquo;patching up my Italian, which had suffered from the ravages of time,&rdquo;
       before I returned to Paris, and settled down to the study of a profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said she, manifesting no emotion at what (in my simplicity) I
      deemed rather a felicitous metaphor; and then, as it were, she let me off
      with a warning. &ldquo;Look out that you don&rsquo;t fall into bad company. Rome is
      full of dangerous people&mdash;painters, Bohemians, republicans, atheists.
      You must be careful. I shall keep my eye upon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by, to my relief, my aunt&rsquo;s director arrived, Monsignor Parlaghi, a
      tall, fat, cheerful, bustling man, who wore a silk cassock edged with
      purple, and a purple netted sash. When he sat down and crossed his legs,
      one saw a square-toed shoe with a silver buckle, and an inch or two of
      purple silk stocking. He began at once to talk with his penitent, about
      some matter to which I (happily) was a stranger; and that gave me my
      chance to break the ice with Rosalys.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had risen to greet the Monsignore, and now stood by the balustrade of
      the terrace, half turned towards the garden, a slender, fragile figure,
      all in white. Her dark hair swept away from her forehead in lovely, long
      undulations, and her white face, beneath it, seemed almost spirit-like in
      its delicacy, almost immaterial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am richer than I thought. I did not know I had a Cousin Rosalys,&rdquo; said
      I.
    </p>
    <p>
      It looks like a sufficiently easy thing to say, doesn&rsquo;t it? And besides,
      hadn&rsquo;t I carefully composed and corrected and conned it beforehand in the
      silence of my mind? But I remember the mighty effort of will it cost me to
      get it said. I suppose it is in the design of nature that Eighteen should
      find it nervous work to break the ice with pretty girls. At any rate, I
      remember how my heart fluttered, and what a hollow, unfamiliar sound my
      voice had; I remember that in the very middle of the enterprise my pluck
      and my presence of mind suddenly deserted me, and everything became a
      blank, and for one horrible moment I thought I was going to break down
      utterly, and stand there staring, blushing, speechless. But then I made a
      further mighty effort of will, a desperate effort, and somehow, though
      they nearly choked me, the premeditated words came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re not <i>real</i> cousins,&rdquo; said she, letting her eyes shine for
      a second on my face. And she explained to me just what the connection
      between us was. &ldquo;But we will call ourselves cousins,&rdquo; she concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst was over; the worst, though Eighteen was still, no doubt,
      conscious of perturbations. I don&rsquo;t know how long we stood chatting
      together there by the balustrade, but presently I said something about the
      garden, and she proposed that we should go down into it. So she led me to
      the other end of the terrace, where there was a flight of steps, and we
      went down into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The merest trifles, in such weather, with a pretty new-found Cousin
      Rosalys for a comrade, are delightful, when one is eighteen, aren&rsquo;t they?
      It was delightful to feel the yielding turf under our feet, the cool grass
      curling round our ankles&mdash;for in Roman gardens, in those old days, it
      wasn&rsquo;t the fashion to clip the grass close, as on an English lawn. It was
      delightful to walk in the shade of the orange-trees, and breathe the air
      sweetened by them. The stillness the dreamy stillness of the soft, sunny
      afternoon was delightful; the crumbling old statues were delightful,
      statues of fauns and dryads, of Pagan gods and goddesses, Pan and Bacchus
      and Diana, their noses broken for the most part, their bodies clothed in
      mosses and leafy vines. And the flowers were delightful; the cyclamens,
      with which&mdash;so abundant were they&mdash;the walls of the garden
      fairly dripped, as with a kind of pink foam; and the roses, and the waxen
      red and white camellias. It was delightful to stop before the great brown
      old fountain, and listen to its tinkle-tinkle of cold water, and peer into
      its basin, all green with weeds, and watch the antics of the goldfishes,
      and the little rainbows the sun struck from the spray. And my Cousin
      Rosalys&rsquo;s white frock was delightful, and her voice was delightful; and
      that perturbation in my heart was exquisitely delightful&mdash;something
      between a thrill and a tremor&mdash;a delicious mixture of fear and
      wonderment and beatitude. I had dragged myself hither to pay a duty-call
      upon my grim old dragon of a great-aunt Elizabeth; and here I was
      wandering amid the hundred delights of a romantic Italian garden, with a
      lovely, white-robed, bright-eyed sylph of a Cousin Rosalys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don&rsquo;t ask me what we talked about. I have only the most fragmentary
      recollection. I remember she told me that her father and mother had died
      in India, when she was a child, and that her father (Aunt Elizabeth&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;ever so much younger brother&ldquo;) had been in the army, and that she had
      lived with Aunt Elizabeth since she was twelve. And I remember she asked
      me to speak French with her, because in Rome she almost always spoke
      Italian or English, and she didn&rsquo;t want to forget her French; and &ldquo;You&rsquo;re,
      of course, almost a Frenchman, living in Paris.&rdquo; So we spoke French
      together, saying <i>ma cousine</i> and <i>mon cousin</i>, which was very
      intimate and pleasant; and she spoke it so well that I expressed some
      surprise. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t put on at least a <i>slight</i> accent, I shall
      tell you you&rsquo;re almost a Frenchman too,&rdquo; I threatened. &ldquo;Oh, I had French
      nurses when I was little,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and afterwards a French governess,
      till I was sixteen. I&rsquo;m eighteen now. How old are you?&rdquo; I had heard that
      girls always liked a man to be older than themselves, and I answered that
      I was nearly twenty. Well, and isn&rsquo;t eighteen nearly twenty?.... Anyhow,
      as I walked back to my lodgings that afternoon, through the busy, twisted,
      sunlit Roman streets, Cousin Rosalys filled all my heart and all my
      thoughts with a white radiance.

      You will conceive whether or not, during the months that followed, I was
      an assiduous visitor at the Palazzo Zacchinelli. But I couldn&rsquo;t spend <i>all</i>
      my time there, and in my enforced absences I needed consolation. I imagine
      I treated Aunt Elizabeth&rsquo;s advice about avoiding bad company as youth is
      wont to treat the counsels of crabbed age. Doubtless my most frequent
      associates were those very painters and Bohemians against whom she had
      particularly cautioned me&mdash;whether they were also republicans and
      atheists, I don&rsquo;t think I ever knew; I can&rsquo;t remember that I inquired, and
      religion and politics were subjects they seldom touched upon
      spontaneously. I dare say I joined the artists&rsquo; club, in the Via Margutta,
      the Circolo Internazionale degli Artisti; I am afraid the Caffe Greco was
      my favourite café; I am afraid I even bought a wide-awake hat, and wore it
      on the back of my head, and tried to look as much like a painter and
      Bohemian myself as nature would permit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bad company? I don&rsquo;t know. It seemed to me very good company indeed. There
      was Jack Everett, tall and slim and athletic, with his eager aquiline
      face, his dark curling hair, the most poetic-looking creature, humorous,
      whimsical, melancholy, imaginative, who used to quote Byron, and plan our
      best practical jokes, and do the loveliest little cupids and roses in
      water-colours. He has since married the girl he was even then in love
      with, and is still living in Rome, and painting cupids and roses. And
      there was d&rsquo;.vignac, <i>le vicomte</i>, a young Frenchman, who had been in
      the Diplomatic Service, and&mdash;superlative distinction!&mdash;&ldquo;ruined
      himself for a woman,&rdquo; and now was striving to keep body and soul together
      by giving fencing lessons; witty, kindly, pathetic d&rsquo;.vignac&mdash;we have
      vanished altogether from each other&rsquo;s ken. There was Ulysse Tavoni, the
      musician, who, when somebody asked him what instrument he played, answered
      cheerily, &ldquo;All instruments.&rdquo; I can testify from personal observation that
      he played the piano and the flute, the guitar, mandoline, fiddle, and
      French horn, the &rsquo;cello and the zither. And there was Kônig, the Austrian
      sculptor, a tiny man with a ferocious black moustache, whom my landlady
      (he having called upon me one day when I was out), unable to remember his
      transalpine name, described to perfection as &ldquo;un Orlando Furioso&mdash;ma
      molto piccolo.&rdquo; There was a dear, dreamy, languid, sentimental Pole,
      blue-eyed and yellow-haired, also a sculptor, whose name I have totally
      forgotten, though we were sworn to &ldquo;hearts&rsquo; brotherhood,&rdquo; He had the most
      astonishing talent for imitating the sounds of animals, the neighing of a
      horse, the crowing of a cock; and when he brayed like a donkey, all the
      donkeys within earshot were deceived, and answered him. And then there was
      Father Flynn, a jolly old bibulous priest from Cork. An uncle of his had
      fought at Waterloo; it was great to hear him tell of his uncle&rsquo;s part in
      the fortunes of the day. It was great, too (for Father Flynn was a fervid
      Irish patriot), to hear him roar out the &ldquo;Wearing of the Green.&rdquo; Between
      the stanzas he would brandish his blackthorn, stick at Everett, and call
      him a &ldquo;murthering English tyrant,&rdquo; to our huge delectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were others and others and others; but these six are those who come
      back first to my memory. They seemed to me very good company indeed; very
      merry, and genial, and amusing; and the life we led together seemed a very
      pleasant life. Oh, our pleasures were of the simplest nature, the
      traditional pleasures of Bohemia; smoking and drinking and talking,
      rambling arm-in-arm through the streets, lounging in studios, going to the
      play or perhaps the circus, or making excursions into the country. Only,
      the capital of our Bohemia was Rome. The streets through which we rambled
      were Roman streets, with their inexhaustible picturesqueness, their
      unending vicissitudes: with their pink and yellow houses, their shrines,
      their fountains, their gardens, their motley wayfarers&mdash;monks and
      soldiers; shaggy pifferari, and contadine in their gaudy costumes, and
      models masquerading as contadine; penitents, beggars, water-carriers,
      hawkers; priests in their vestments, bearing the Host, attended by
      acolytes, with burning tapers, who rang little bells, whilst men uncovered
      and women crossed themselves; and everywhere, everywhere, English
      tourists, with their noses in Baedeker. It was Rome with its bright sun,
      and its deep shadows; with its Ghetto, its Tiber, its Castel Sant&rsquo; Angelo;
      with its churches, and palaces, and ruins; with its Villa Borghese and its
      Pincian Hill; with its waving green Campagna at its gates. We smoked and
      talked and drank&mdash;Chianti, of course, and sunny Orvieto, and fabled
      Est-Est-Est, all in those delightful pear-shaped, wicker-covered flasks,
      which of themselves, I fancy, would confer a flavour upon indifferent
      wine. We made excursions to Tivoli and Frascati, to Monte Cavo and Nemi,
      to Acqua Acetosa. We patronised Pulcinella, and the marionettes, and
      (better still) the <i>imitation</i> marionettes. We blew horns on the
      night of Epiphany, we danced at masked balls, we put on dominoes and
      romped in the Corso during carnival, throwing flowers and confetti, and
      struggling to extinguish other people&rsquo;s <i>moccoli</i>. And on rainy days
      (with an effort I can remember that there were <i>some</i> rainy days)
      Everett and I would sit with d&rsquo;.vignac in his fencing gallery, and talk
      and smoke, and smoke and talk and talk. D&rsquo;.vignac was six-and-twenty,
      Everett was twenty-two, and I was &ldquo;nearly twenty.&rdquo; D&rsquo;.vignac would tell us
      of his past, of his adventures in Spain and Japan and South America, and
      of the lady for the love of whom he had come to grief. Everett and I would
      sigh profoundly, and shake our heads, and exchange sympathetic glances,
      and assure him that we knew what love was&mdash;we were victims of
      unfortunate attachments ourselves. To each other we had confided
      everything, Everett and I. He had told me all about his unrequited passion
      for Maud Eaton, and I had rhapsodised to him by the hour about Cousin
      Rosalys. &ldquo;But you, old chap, you&rsquo;re to be envied,&rdquo; he would cry. &ldquo;Here you
      are in the same town with her, by Jove! You can <i>see</i> her, you can
      plead your cause. Think of that. I wish I had half your luck. Maud is far
      away in England, buried in a country-house down in Lancashire. She might
      as well be on another planet, for all the good I get of her. But you&mdash;why,
      you can see your Cousin Rosalys this very hour if you like! Oh, heavens,
      what wouldn&rsquo;t I give for half your luck!&rdquo; The wheel of Time, the wheel of
      Time! Everett and Maud are married, but Cousin Rosalys and I.... Heigh-ho!
      I wonder whether, in our thoughts of ancient days, it is more what we
      remember or what we forget that makes them sweet? Anyhow, for the moment,
      we forget the dismal things that have happened since.

    <p>
      Yes, I was in the same town with her, by Jove; I could <i>see</i> her. And
      indeed I did see her many times every week. Like the villain in a
      melodrama, I led a double life. When I was not disguised as a Bohemian, in
      a velvet jacket and a wide-awake, smoking and talking and holding wassail
      with my boon companions, you might have observed a young man attired in
      the height of the prevailing fashion (his top-hat and varnished boots
      flashing fire in the eyes of the Roman populace), going to call on his
      Aunt Elizabeth. And his Aunt Elizabeth, pleased by such dutiful
      attentions, rewarded him with frequent invitations to dinner. Her other
      guests would be old ladies like herself, and old gentlemen, and priests,
      priests, priests. So that Rosalys and I, the only young ones present, were
      naturally paired together. After dinner Rosalys would play and sing, while
      I hung over her piano. Oh, how beautifully she played Chopin! How
      ravishingly she sang! Schubert&rsquo;s <i>Wohin, and Rôslein, Rôslein, Rôslein
      roth;</i> and Gounod&rsquo;s <i>Sérénade</i> and his <i>Barcarolle</i>:

     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And how angelically beautiful she looked! Her delicate, pale face, and her
      dark, undulating hair, and her soft red lips; and then her eyes&mdash;her
      luminous, mysterious dark eyes, in whose depths, far, far within, you
      could discern her spirit shining starlike. And her hands, white and
      slender and graceful, images in miniature of herself; with what
      incommunicable wonder and admiration I used to watch them as they moved
      above the keys. &ldquo;A woman who plays Chopin ought to have three hands&mdash;two
      to play with, and one for the man who&rsquo;s listening to hold.&rdquo; That was a
      pleasantry which I meditated much in secret, and a thousand times aspired
      to murmur in the player&rsquo;s ear, but invariably, when it came to the point
      of doing so, my courage failed me. &ldquo;You can see her, you can plead your
      cause.&rdquo; Bless me, I never dared even vaguely to hint that I had any cause
      to plead. I imagine young love is always terribly afraid of revealing
      itself to its object, terribly afraid and terribly desirous. Whenever I
      was not in Cousin Rosalys&rsquo;s presence, my heart was consumed with longing
      to tell her that I loved her, to ask her whether perhaps she might be not
      wholly indifferent to me; I made the boldest resolutions, committed to
      memory the most persuasive declarations. But from the instant I <i>was</i>
      in her presence again&mdash;mercy, what panic seized me!
    </p>
    <p>
      I could have died sooner than speak the words that I was dying to speak,
      ask the question I was dying to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      I called assiduously at the Palazzo Zacchinelli, and my aunt bade me to
      dinner a good deal, and then one afternoon every week she used to drive
      with Rosalys on the Pincian. There was one afternoon every week when all
      Rome drove on the Pincian; was it Saturday? At any rate, you may be very
      sure I did not let such opportunities escape me for getting a bow and a
      smile from my cousin. Sometimes she would leave the carriage and join me,
      while Aunt Elizabeth, with Sandro in her lap, drove on, round and round
      the consecrated circle; and we would stroll together in the winding
      alleys, or stand by the terrace and look off over the roofs of the city,
      and watch the sunset blaze and fade behind St. Peter&rsquo;s. You know that
      unexampled view&mdash;the roofs of Rome spread out beneath you like the
      surface of a troubled sea, and the dome of St. Peter&rsquo;s, an island rising
      in the distance, and the sunset sky behind it. We would stand there in
      silence perhaps, at most saying very little, while the sunset burned
      itself out; and for one of us, at least, it was a moment of ineffable,
      impossible enchantment. She was so near to me&mdash;so near, the slender
      figure in the pretty frock, with the dark hair, and the captivating hat,
      and the furs; with her soft glowing eyes, with her exquisite fragrance of
      girlhood; she was so near to me, so alone with me, despite the crowd about
      us, and I loved her so! Oh, why couldn&rsquo;t I tell her? Why couldn&rsquo;t she
      divine it? People said that women always knew by intuition when men were
      in love with them. Why couldn&rsquo;t Rosalys divine that I loved her, <i>how</i>
      I loved her, and make me a sign, and so enable me to speak?
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently&mdash;and all too soon&mdash;she would return to the carriage,
      and drive away with Aunt Elizabeth; and I, in the lugubrious twilight,
      would descend the great marble Spanish staircase (a perilous path, amongst
      models and beggars and other things) to the Piazza, and seek out Jack
      Everett at the Caffé Greco. Thence he and I would go off to dine together
      somewhere, condoling with each other upon our ill-starred passions. After
      dinner, pulling our hats over our eyes, two desperately tragic forms, we
      would set ourselves upon the traces of d&rsquo;.vignac and Kônig and Father
      Flynn, determined to forget our sorrows in an evening of dissipation,
      saying regretfully, &ldquo;These are the evil courses to which the love of woman
      has reduced us&mdash;a couple of the best-meaning fellows in Christendom,
      and surely born for better ends.&rdquo; When we were children (hasn&rsquo;t Kenneth
      Grahame written it for us in a golden book?) we played at conspirators and
      pirates. When we were a little older, and Byron or Musset had superseded
      Fenimore Cooper, some of us found there was an unique excitement to be got
      from the game of Blighted Beings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, why couldn&rsquo;t I tell her? Why couldn&rsquo;t she divine it, and make me an
      encouraging sign?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But, of course, in the end I did tell her. It was on the night of my
      birthday. I had dined at the Palazzo Zacchinelli, and with the dessert a
      great cake was brought in and set before me. A number of little red
      candles were burning round it, and embossed upon it in frosting was this
      device:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A birthday-piece
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      From Rosalys,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Wishing birthdays more in plenty
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To her cousin &ldquo;nearly twenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And counting the candles, I perceived they were <i>nineteen.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably my joy was somewhat tempered by confusion, to think that my
      little equivocation on the subject of my age had been discovered. As I
      looked up from the cake to its giver, I met a pair of eyes that were
      gleaming with mischievous raillery; and she shook her head at me, and
      murmured, &ldquo;Oh, you fibber!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How on earth did you find out?&rdquo; I wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;a little bird,&rdquo; laughed she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s at all respectful of you to call Aunt Elizabeth a
      little bird,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner we went out upon the terrace. It was a warm night, and there
      was a moon. A moonlit night in Italy&mdash;dark velvet shot with silver.
      And the air was intoxicant with the scent of hyacinths. We were in March;
      the garden had become a wilderness of spring flowers, narcissuses and
      jonquils, crocuses, anemones, tulips, and hyacinths; hyacinths, everywhere
      hyacinths. Rosalys had thrown a bit of white lace over her hair. Oh, I
      assure you, in the moonlight, with the white lace over her hair, with her
      pale face, and her eyes, her shining, mysterious eyes&mdash;oh, I promise
      you, she was lovely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How beautiful the garden is, in the moonlight, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The
      shadows, and the statues, and the fountains. And how sweet the air is.
      They&rsquo;re the hyacinths that smell so sweet. The hyacinth is your birthday
      flower, you know. Hyacinths bring happiness to people born in March.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked into her eyes, and my heart thrilled and thrilled. And then,
      somehow, somehow... Oh, I don&rsquo;t remember what I said; only somehow,
      somehow... Ah, but I do remember very clearly what she answered&mdash;so
      softly, so softly, while her hand lay in mine. I remember it very clearly,
      and at the memory, even now, years afterwards, I confess my heart thrills
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were joined, in a minute or two, by Monsignor Parlaghi, and we tried to
      behave as if he were not unwelcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam and Eve were driven from Eden for their guilt; but it was Innocence
      that lost our Eden for Rosalys and me. In our egregious innocence, we had
      determined that I should call upon Aunt Elizabeth in the morning, and
      formally demand her sanction to our engagement! Do I need to recount the
      history of that interview? Of my aunt&rsquo;s incredulity, that gradually
      changed to scorn and anger? Of how I was fleered at and flouted, and
      taunted with my youth, and called a fool and a coxcomb, and sent about my
      business with the information that the portals of the Palazzo Zacchinelli
      would remain eternally closed against me for the future, and that my
      people &ldquo;would be written to"? I was not even allowed to see my cousin to
      say good-bye. &ldquo;And mind you, we&rsquo;ll have no letter writing,&rdquo; cried Aunt
      Elizabeth. &ldquo;I shall forbid Rosalys to receive any letters from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Guilt (we are taught) can be annulled, and its punishment remitted, if we
      do heartily repent. But innocence? Goodness knows how heartily I repented;
      yet I never found that a pennyweight of the punishment was remitted. At
      the week&rsquo;s end I got a letter from my people recalling me to Paris. And I
      never saw Rosalys again. And some years afterwards she married an Italian,
      a nephew of Cardinal Badascalchi. And in 1887, at Viareggio, she died....

      FLOWER O&rsquo; THE CLOVE

      I
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the first-floor
      sitting-room of a lodging-house in Great College Street, Westminster, a
      young man&mdash;he was tall and thin, with a good deal of rather longish
      light-coloured hair, somewhat tumbled about; and he wore a pince-nez, and
      was in slippers and the oldest of tattered coats&mdash;a man of
      thirty-something was seated at a writing-table, diligently scribbling at
      what an accustomed eye might have recognised as &ldquo;copy,&rdquo; and negligently
      allowing the smoke from a cigarette to curl round and stain the thumb and
      forefinger of his idle hand, when the lodging-house maid-servant opened
      his door, and announced excitedly, &ldquo;A lady to see you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the air of one taken altogether by surprise, and at a cruel
      disadvantage, the writer dropped his pen, and jumped up. He was in
      slippers and a disgraceful coat, not to dwell upon the condition of his
      hair. &ldquo;You ought to have kept her downstairs until&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       he began, frowning upon the maid; and at that point his visitor entered
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a handsome, dashing-looking young woman, in a toilette that
      breathed the very last and crispest savour of Parisian elegance: a hat
      that was a tangle of geraniums, an embroidered jacket, white gloves, a
      skirt that frou-froued breezily as she moved; and she carried an amazing
      silver-hilted sunshade, a thing like a folded gonfalon, a thing of red
      silk gleaming through draperies of black lace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poising lightly near the threshold, with a little smile of interrogation,
      this bewildering vision said, &ldquo;Have I the honour of addressing Mr. William
      Stretton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man bowed a vague acknowledgment of that name; but his gaze,
      through the lenses of his pince-nez, was all perplexity and question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very fortunate in finding you at home. I&rsquo;ve called to see you about a
      matter of business,&rdquo; she informed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; he wondered. Then he added, with a pathetic shake of the head, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      the last man in the world whom any one could wisely choose to see about a
      matter of business; but such as I am, I&rsquo;m all at your disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; she rejoined cheerily. &ldquo;I infinitely prefer to
      transact business with people who are unbusinesslike. One has some chance
      of overreaching them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have every chance of over-reaching me,&rdquo; sighed he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a jolly quarter of the town you live in,&rdquo; she commented. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so
      picturesque and Gothic and dilapidated, with such an atmosphere of
      academic calm. It reminds me of Oxford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented he, &ldquo;it <i>is</i> a bit like Oxford. Was your business
      connected&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it <i>is</i> like Oxford?&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;Then never tell me again
      that there&rsquo;s nothing in intuitions. I&rsquo;ve never been in Oxford, but
      directly I passed the gateway of Dean&rsquo;s Yard, I felt reminded of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s undoubtedly a lot in intuitions,&rdquo; he agreed; &ldquo;and for the future
      I shall carefully abstain from telling you there isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those things are gardens, over the way, behind the wall, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
       she asked, looking out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;those things are gardens, the gardens of the Abbey. The
      canons and people have their houses there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very comfortable and nice,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Plenty of grass. And the trees
      aren&rsquo;t bad, either, for town trees. It must be rather fun to be a canon.
      As I live,&rdquo; she cried, turning back into the room, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got a Pleyel.
      This is the first Pleyel I&rsquo;ve seen in England. Let me congratulate you on
      your taste in pianos.&rdquo; And with her gloved hands she struck a chord and
      made a run or two. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need the tuner soon, though. It&rsquo;s just the
      shadow of a shadow out. I was brought up on Pleyels. Do you know, I&rsquo;ve
      half a mind to make you a confidence?&rdquo; she questioned brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do make it, I pray you,&rdquo; he encouraged her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I believe, if you were to offer me a chair, I believe I could
      bring myself to sit down,&rdquo; she admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he exclaimed; and she sank rustling into the chair
      that he pushed forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now for my business,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Would you just put this thing
      somewhere?&rdquo; She offered him her sunshade, which he took and handled
      somewhat gingerly. &ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t be afraid. It&rsquo;s quite tame,&rdquo; she
      laughed, &ldquo;though I admit it looks a bit ferocious. What a sweet room
      you&rsquo;ve got&mdash;so manny, and smoky, and booky. Are they all real books?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More or less real,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;as real as any books ever are that a
      fellow gets for review.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you got them for review?&rdquo; she repeated, with vivacity. &ldquo;How terribly
      exciting. I&rsquo;ve never seen a book before that&rsquo;s actually passed through a
      reviewer&rsquo;s hands. They don&rsquo;t look much the worse for it. Whatever else you
      said about them, I trust you didn&rsquo;t deny that they make nice domestic
      ornaments. But this isn&rsquo;t business. <i>You</i> wouldn&rsquo;t call this
      business?&rdquo; she enquired, with grave curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I should call this pleasure,&rdquo; he assured her, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Would</i> you?&rdquo; She raised her eyebrows. &ldquo;Ah, but then you&rsquo;re
      English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I look English?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo; He hesitated for a second, studying her. &ldquo;You certainly
      don&rsquo;t dress English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid Î&rdquo; She made a fervent gesture. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a miserable sinner, but
      at least I&rsquo;m incapable of that. However, if you were really kind, you&rsquo;d
      affect just a little curiosity to know the errand to which you owe my
      presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m devoured by curiosity,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she raised her eyebrows. &ldquo;You are? Then why don&rsquo;t you show it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps because I have a sense of humour&mdash;amongst other reasons,&rdquo; he
      suggested, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, since you&rsquo;re devoured by curiosity, you must know,&rdquo; she began; but
      broke off suddenly&mdash;&ldquo;Apropos, I wonder whether <i>you</i> could be
      induced to tell <i>me</i> something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay I could, if it&rsquo;s anything within my sphere of knowledge.&rdquo; He
      paused, expectant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then tell me, please, why you keep your Japanese fan in your fireplace,&rdquo;
       she requested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I? Doesn&rsquo;t it strike you as a good place for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admirable. But my interest was psychological. I was wondering by what
      mental processes you came to hit upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, to be frank, it wasn&rsquo;t I who hit upon it; it isn&rsquo;t my
      Japanese fan. It&rsquo;s a conceit of my landlady&rsquo;s. This is an age of paradox,
      you know. Would you prefer silver paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Must</i> one have one or the other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re making it painfully clear,&rdquo; he cautioned her, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ve never
      lived in lodgings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you go on at this rate,&rdquo; she retorted, laughing, &ldquo;I shall never get my
      task accomplished. Here are twenty times that I&rsquo;ve commenced it, and
      twenty times you&rsquo;ve put me off. Shall we now, at last, proceed seriously
      to business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on my account, I beg. I&rsquo;m not in the slightest hurry,&rdquo; protested he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you were devoured by curiosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I say that?&rdquo; He knitted his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been aphasia. I meant contentment,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devoured by contentment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, as well as by curiosity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The phrase is novel,&rdquo; she mused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the occupation of my life to seek for novel phrases,&rdquo; he reminded
      her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m what somebody or other has called a literary man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you enjoy what somebody or other has called beating about the bush?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugely&mdash;with such a fellow-beater,&rdquo; he responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You drive me to extremities.&rdquo; She shook her head. &ldquo;I see there&rsquo;s nothing
      for it but to plunge in <i>médias res</i>. You must know, then, that I
      have been asked to call upon you by a friend&mdash;by my friend Miss
      Johannah Rothe&mdash;I beg your pardon; I never <i>can</i> remember that
      she&rsquo;s changed her name&mdash;my friend Miss Johannah Silver&mdash;but
      Silver <i>née</i> Rothe&mdash;of Silver Towers, in the County of Sussex.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Ah, yes. Then never tell me again that there&rsquo;s nothing in
      intuitions. I&rsquo;ve never met Miss Silver, but directly you crossed the
      threshold of this room, I began to feel vaguely reminded of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s a lot in intuitions,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t think to
      disconcert me. My friend Miss Silver&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was his turn to raise his eyebrows. &ldquo;Your <i>friend?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Considering the sacrifice I&rsquo;m making on her behalf to-day, it&rsquo;s strange
      you should throw doubt upon my friendship for her,&rdquo; she argued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make your sacrifices with a cheerful countenance. I should never have
      guessed that you weren&rsquo;t entirely happy. But forgive my interruption. You
      were about to say that your friend Miss Silver&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My occasional friend,&rdquo; she substituted. &ldquo;Sometimes, I confess, we quarrel
      like everything, and remain at daggers drawn for months. She&rsquo;s such a
      flightly creature, dear Johannah, she not infrequently gets me into a
      perfect peck of trouble. But since she&rsquo;s fallen heir to all this money,
      you&rsquo;d be surprised to behold the devotion her friends have shown her. I
      couldn&rsquo;t very well refuse to follow their example. One&rsquo;s human, you see;
      and one can&rsquo;t dress like this for nothing, can one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, I&rsquo;m not in a position to answer you. I&rsquo;ve never tried,&rdquo;
       laughed he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the absence of evidence to the contrary, I think we may safely assume
      one can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;However, here you are, beating about the bush
      again. I come to you as Johannah&rsquo;s emissary. She desires me to ask you
      several questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said he, a trifle uncomfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would be glad to know,&rdquo; his visitor declared, looking straight into
      his eyes, and smiling a little gravely, &ldquo;why you have been so excessively
      nasty to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I been nasty to her?&rdquo; he asked, with an innocence that was palpably
      counterfeit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you have?&rdquo; She still looked gravely, smilingly, into his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how.&rdquo; He maintained his feint of innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;ve responded somewhat ungraciously to her overtures
      of friendship?&rdquo; she suggested. &ldquo;Do you think it was nice to answer her
      letters with those curt little formal notes of yours? Look. Johannah sat
      down to write to you. And she began her letter <i>Dear Mr. Stretton</i>.
      And then she simply couldn&rsquo;t. So she tore up the sheet, and began another
      <i>My Dear Cousin Will</i>. And what did she receive in reply? A note
      beginning <i>Dear Miss Silver</i>. Do you think that was kind? Don&rsquo;t you
      think it was the least bit mortifying? And why have you refused in such a
      stiff-necked way to go down to see her at Silver Towers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;in all fairness, in all logic, your questions ought
      to be put the other way round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bother logic! But put them any way you like,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What right had Miss Silver to expect me to multiply the complications of
      my life by rushing into an ecstatic friendship with her? And why, being
      very well as I am in town just now, why should I disarrange myself by a
      journey into the country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why indeed?&rdquo; she echoed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can give no reason. Why should one
      ever do any one else a kindness? Your cousin has conceived a great desire
      to meet you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a great desire!&rdquo; He tossed his head. &ldquo;One knows these great desires.
      She&rsquo;ll live it down. A man named Burrell has been stuffing her up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuffing her up?&rdquo; She smiled enquiringly. &ldquo;The expression is new to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Greening her, filling her head with all sorts of nonsensical delusions,
      painting my portrait for her in all the colours of the rainbow. Oh, I know
      my Burrell. He&rsquo;s tried to stuff <i>me</i> up, too, about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh? Has he? What has he said?&rdquo; she questioned eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The usual rubbishy things one does say, when one wants to stuff a fellow
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that she&rsquo;s tremendously good-looking, with hair and eyes and things,
      and very charming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a dear good person the man named Burrell must be,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a bad chap,&rdquo; he conceded, &ldquo;but you must remember that he&rsquo;s her
      solicitor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, remembering that, you weren&rsquo;t to be stuffed?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she was charming and good-looking, it was a reason the more for
      avoiding her,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; She looked perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing on earth so tiresome as charming women. They&rsquo;re all
      exactly alike,&rdquo; asserted he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; his guest exclaimed, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nobody could pretend that <i>you&rsquo;re</i> exactly alike,&rdquo; he assured
      her hastily. &ldquo;I own at once that you&rsquo;re delightfully different. But
      Burrell has no knack for character drawing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re extremely flattering. But aren&rsquo;t you taking a slightly one-sided
      point of view? Let us grant, for the sake of the argument, that it is
      Johannah&rsquo;s bad luck to be charming and good-looking. Nevertheless, she
      still has claims on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s your cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by the left hand,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared for an instant, biting her lip. Then she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And only my second or third cousin at that,&rdquo; he went on serenely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with eyes that were half whimsical, half pleading.
      &ldquo;Would you mind being quite serious for a moment?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Because
      Johannah&rsquo;s situation, absurd as it seems, really is terribly serious for
      Johannah. I should like to submit it to your better judgment. We&rsquo;ll drop
      the question of cousinship, if you wish&mdash;though it&rsquo;s the simple fact
      that you&rsquo;re her only blood-relation in this country, where she feels
      herself the forlornest sort of alien. She&rsquo;s passed her entire life in
      Italy and France, you know, and this is the first visit she&rsquo;s made to
      England since her childhood. But we&rsquo;ll drop the question of cousinship. At
      any rate, Johannah is a human being. Well, consider her plight a little.
      She finds herself in the most painful, the most humiliating circumstances
      that can be imagined; and you&rsquo;re the only person living who can make them
      easier for her. Involuntarily&mdash;in spite of herself&mdash;she&rsquo;s come
      into possession of a fortune that naturally, morally, belongs to you. She
      can&rsquo;t help it. It&rsquo;s been left to her by will&mdash;by the will of a man
      who never saw her, never had any kind of relations with her, but chose her
      for his heir just because her mother, who died when Johannah was a baby,
      had chanced to be his cousin. And there the poor girl is. Can&rsquo;t you see
      how like a thief she must feel at the best? Can&rsquo;t you see how much worse
      you make it for her, when she holds out her hand, and you refuse to take
      it? Is that magnanimous of you? Isn&rsquo;t it cruel? You couldn&rsquo;t treat her
      with greater unkindness if she&rsquo;d actually designed, and schemed, and
      intrigued, to do you out of your inheritance, instead of coming into it in
      the passive way she has. After all, she&rsquo;s a human being, she&rsquo;s a woman.
      Think of her pride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of mine,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see that your pride is involved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To put it plainly, I&rsquo;m the late Sir William Silver&rsquo;s illegitimate son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? What of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you fancy I should enjoy being taken up and patronised by his
      legitimate heir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, starting to her feet. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t think I would be capable
      of anything so base as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he saw that her eyes had suddenly filled with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, I beg your pardon a thousand times,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
      would be utterly incapable of anything that was not generous and noble.
      But you must remember that I had never seen you. How could I know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now that you <i>have</i> seen me,&rdquo; she responded, her eyes all
      smiles again, &ldquo;now that I have put my pride in my pocket, and bearded you
      in your den, I don&rsquo;t mind confiding in you that it&rsquo;s nearly lunchtime, and
      also that I&rsquo;m ravenously hungry. Could you ring your bell, and order up
      something in the nature of meat and drink? And while you are about it, you
      might tell your landlady or some one to pack your bag. We take,&rdquo; she
      mentioned, examining a tiny watch, that seemed nothing more than a
      frivolous incrustation of little diamonds and rubies, &ldquo;we take the
      three-sixteen for Silver Towers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>eated opposite her
      in the railway-carriage, as their train bore them through the pleasant
      dales and woods of Surrey, Will Stretton fell to studying his cousin&rsquo;s
      appearance. &ldquo;Burrell was right,&rdquo; he told himself; &ldquo;she really is
      tremendously good-looking,&rdquo; and that, in spite of a perfectly reckless
      irregularity of feature. Her nose was too small, but it was a delicate,
      pert, pretty nose, notwithstanding. Her mouth was too large, but it was a
      beautiful mouth, all the same, softly curved and red as scarlet, with
      sensitive, humorous little quirks in its corners. Her eyes he could admire
      without reservation, brown and pellucid, with the wittiest, teasingest,
      mockingest lights dancing in them, yet at the same time a deeper light
      that was pensive, tender, womanly. Her hair, too, he decided, was quite
      lovely, abundant, undulating, black, blue-black even, but fine, but silky,
      escaping in a flutter of small curls above her brow. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like black
      foam,&rdquo; he said. And he would have been ready to go to war for her
      complexion, though it was so un-English a complexion that one might have
      mistaken her for a native of the France or Italy she had inhabitated:
      warm, dusky white, with an elusive shadow of rose glowing through it. Yes,
      she was tremendously good-looking, he concluded. She looked fresh and
      strong and real. She looked alert, alive, full of the spring and the joy
      of life. She looked as if she could feel quick and deep, as if her blood
      flowed swiftly, and was red. He liked her face, and he liked her figure&mdash;it
      was supple and vigorous. He liked the way she dressed&mdash;there was
      something daring and spirited in the uncompromising, unabashed luxury of
      it. &ldquo;Who ever saw such a hat&mdash;or such a sunshade?&rdquo; he reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no coach-and-four to meet us at the station,&rdquo; she warned him,
      as they neared their journey&rsquo;s end, &ldquo;because I have no horses. But we&rsquo;ll
      probably find Madame Dornaye there, <i>piaffer</i>-ing in person. Can you
      resign yourself to the prospect of driving up to your ancestral mansion in
      a hired fly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could even, at a pinch, resign myself to walking,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;But
      who is Madame Dornaye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Dornaye is my burnt-offering to that terrible sort of fetich
      called the County. She&rsquo;s what might be technically termed my chaperon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to be sure,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I had forgotten. Of course, you&rsquo;d have a
      chaperon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means of course,&rdquo; she corrected him. &ldquo;Until the other day I&rsquo;d never
      thought of such a thing. But it&rsquo;s all along o&rsquo; the man named Burrell. He
      insisted that I mustn&rsquo;t live alone&mdash;that I was too young. He has such
      violent hallucinations about people&rsquo;s ages. He said the County would be
      horrified. I must have an old woman, a sound, reliable old woman, to live
      with me. I begged and implored <i>him</i> to come and try it, but he
      protested with tears in his eyes that he wasn&rsquo;t an old woman. So I sent
      for Madame Dornaye, who is, every inch of her. She&rsquo;s the widow of a man
      who used to be a professor at the Sorbonne, or something. I&rsquo;ve known her
      for at least a hundred years. She&rsquo;s connected in some roundabout way with
      the family of my father&rsquo;s stepmother. She&rsquo;s like a little dry brown leaf;
      and she plays Chopin <i>comme pas un</i>; and she lends me a false air of
      respectability, I suppose. She calls me <i>Jeanne ma fille</i>, if you can
      believe it, as if my name weren&rsquo;t common Johannah. If you chance to please
      her, she&rsquo;ll very likely call you <i>Jean mon fils</i>. But see how things
      turn out. The man named Burrell also insisted that I must put on mourning,
      as a symbol of my grief for the late Sir William. That I positively
      refused to think of. So the County&rsquo;s horrified, all the same&mdash;which
      proves the futility of concessions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; questioned Will. &ldquo;What does the County do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It comes and calls on me, and walks round me, and stares, with a funny
      little deprecating smile, as it I were some outlandish and not very proper
      animal, cast up by the sea. To begin with, there&rsquo;s the vicar, with all his
      wives and daughters. <i>Their</i> emotions are complicated by the fact
      that I am a Papist. Then there&rsquo;s old Lord Belgard; and there&rsquo;s Mrs.
      Breckenbridge, with her marriageable sons; and there&rsquo;s the Bishop of
      Salchester, with his Bishopess, Dean, and Chapter. The dear good people
      make up parties in the afternoon, to come and have a look at me; and they
      sip my tea with an air of guilt, as if it smacked of profligacy; and they
      suppress demure little knowing glances among themselves. And then at last
      they go away, shaking their heads, and talking me over in awe-struck
      voices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see them, I can hear them,&rdquo; Will laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you in English a somewhat homely proverbial expression about the
      fat and the fire?&rdquo; asked Johannah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the fat getting into the fire? Yes,&rdquo; said Will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, to employ that somewhat homely proverbial expression,&rdquo; she
      went on, &ldquo;the fat got into the fire at the Bishop&rsquo;s palace. Mrs. Rawley
      was kind enough to write and ask us to dinner, and she added that she had
      heard I sang, and wouldn&rsquo;t I bring some music? But nobody had ever told me
      that it&rsquo;s bad form in England to sing <i>well</i>. So, after dinner, when
      Mrs. Rawley said, &rsquo;Now, Miss Silver, do sing us something,&rsquo; I made the
      incredible blunder of singing as well as I could. I sang the <i>Erlkônig</i>,
      and Madame Dornaye played the accompaniment, and we both did our very
      bestest, in our barefaced, Continental way. We were a little surprised,
      and vastly enlightened, to perceive that we&rsquo;d shocked everybody. And
      by-and-by the Bishop&rsquo;s daughters consented to sing in their turn, and then
      we saw the correct British style of doing it. If you don&rsquo;t want to be
      considered rowdyish and noisy in a British drawing-room, you must sing
      under your breath, faintly, faintingly, as if you were afraid somebody
      might hear you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor dear young lady,&rdquo; her cousin commiserated her, &ldquo;fancy your only
      just discovering that. It&rsquo;s one of the foundation-stones of our social
      constitution. If you sing with any art or with any feeling, you expose
      yourself to being mistaken for a paid professional.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another thing that&rsquo;s horrified the County,&rdquo; pursued Johannah, &ldquo;is the
      circumstance that I keep no horses. I don&rsquo;t like horses&mdash;except in
      pictures. In pictures, I admit at once, they make a very pleasant
      decorative motive. But in life&mdash;they&rsquo;re too strong and too
      unintelligent; and they&rsquo;re perpetually bolting. By-the-bye, please choose
      a good feeble jaded one, when you engage our fly. I&rsquo;m devoted to donkeys,
      though. They&rsquo;re every bit as decorative as the horse, and they&rsquo;re really
      wise&mdash;they only baulk. I had a perfect love of a little donkey in
      Italy; his name was Angelo. If I decide to stay in England, I shall have a
      spanking team of four donkeys, with scarlet trappings and silver bells.
      But the County say &rsquo;Oh, you <i>must</i> have horses,&rsquo; and casts its eyes
      appealingly to heaven when I say I <i>won&rsquo;t</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The County lacks a sense of situations,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really a
      deliciously fresh one&mdash;a big country house, and not a horse in the
      stables.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apropos of the house, that brings me to another point,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;The
      County feels very strongly that I ought to put the house in repair&mdash;that
      dear old wonderful, rambling, crumbling house. They take it as the final
      crushing evidence of my depravity, that I prefer to leave it in its
      present condition of picturesque decay. I&rsquo;m sure you agree with me, that
      it would be high treason to allow a carpenter or mason to lay a hand on
      it. By-the-bye, I hope you have no conscientious scruples against speaking
      French; for Madame Dornaye only knows two words of English, and those she
      mispronounces. There she is&mdash;yes, that little black and grey thing,
      in the frock. She&rsquo;s come to meet me, because we had a bet. You owe me five
      shillings,&rdquo; she called out to Madame Dornaye, as Will helped her from the
      carriage. &ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;ve brought him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Dornaye, who had a pair of humorous old French eyes, responded,
      blinking them, &ldquo;Oh, before I pay you, I shall have to be convinced that it
      is really he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s really he,&rdquo; laughed Will; &ldquo;but rather than let so
      immaterial a detail cost you five shillings, I&rsquo;m prepared to maintain with
      my dying breath that there&rsquo;s no such person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind him,&rdquo; interposed Johannah. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s trying to flatter you up,
      because he wants you to call him <i>Jean mon fils</i>, as if his name
      weren&rsquo;t common William.&rdquo; Then, to him, &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; she said, with an imperious
      gesture, &ldquo;go and find a vehicle with a good tired horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when the vehicle with the good tired horse had brought them to their
      destination, and they stood before the hall-door of Silver Towers,
      Johannah looked up at the escutcheon carved in the pale-grey stone above
      it, and said pensively, &ldquo;On a field argent, a heart gules, crowned with an
      imperial crown or; and the motto, &rsquo;Qu&rsquo;il régne!&rsquo; If, when you got my first
      letter, Cousin Will, if you&rsquo;d remembered the arms of our family, and the
      motto&mdash;if you had &rsquo;let it reign&rsquo;&mdash;I should have been spared the
      trouble and expense of a journey to town to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I should have missed a precious experience,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You forget
      what I couldn&rsquo;t help being supremely conscious of&mdash;that I bear those
      arms with a difference. I hope, though, that you won&rsquo;t begrudge the
      journey to town. I think there are certain aspects of your character that
      I might never have discovered if I&rsquo;d met you in any other way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening Johannah wrote a letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Mr. Burrell,&mdash;<i>Ce que femme veut, Dieu le veut</i>. The first
      part of my rash little prophecy has already come true. Will Stretton is
      staying in this house, a contented guest. At the present moment he&rsquo;s
      hovering about the piano, where Madame Dornaye is playing Chopin; and he&rsquo;s
      just remarked that he never hears Chopin without thinking of those lines

      I quite agree with you, he <i>is</i> a charming creature. So now I repeat
      the second part of my rash little prophecy: Before the summer&rsquo;s over he
      will have accepted at least a good half of his paternal fortune. <i>Ce que
      femme veut, le diable ne saurait pas l&rsquo;empêcher.</i> He will, he shall,

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ill left his room
      somewhat early the next morning, and went down into the garden. The sun
      was shining briskly, the dew still sparkled on the grass, the air was
      heady with a hundred keen earth-odours. A mile away, beyond the wide green
      levels of Sumpter Meads, the sea glowed blue as the blue of larkspur,
      under the blue June sky. And everywhere, everywhere, innumerable birds
      piped and twittered, filling the world with a sense of gay activity, of
      whole-hearted, high-hearted life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! up already?&rdquo; a voice called softly, from behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned, and met Johannah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, since you are?&rdquo; he responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, and gave him her hand, a warm, elastic hand, firm of grasp.
      In a garden-hat and a white frock, her eyes beaming, her cheeks faintly
      flushed, she seemed to him a sort of beautiful incarnation of the spirit
      of the summer morning, its freshness, and sweetness, and richness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we furriners,&rdquo; she explained; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re all shocking early risers. In
      Italy we love the day when it is young, and deem it middle-aged by eight
      o&rsquo;clock. But in England I had heard it was the fashion to lie late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I woke, and couldn&rsquo;t go to sleep again, so I tossed the fashion to the
      winds. Perhaps it was a sort of dim presentiment that I should surprise
      Aurora walking in the garden, that banished slumber,&rdquo; he suggested, with a
      flourish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flowery speeches are best met by flowery deeds,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Come with me
      to the rosery, and I will give you a red, red rose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in the rosery, as she stood close to him, pinning the red, red rose in
      his coat, her smooth cheek and fragrant hair so near, so near, he felt his
      heart all at once begin to throb, and he had to control a sudden absurd
      longing to put his arms round her and kiss her. &ldquo;Good heavens,&rdquo; he said to
      himself, &ldquo;I must be on my guard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; she cried, bestowing upon her task a gentle pat, by way of
      finish, &ldquo;that makes us quits.&rdquo; And she raised her eyes to his, and held
      them for an instant with a smile that did anything but soothe the trouble
      in his heart, such a sly little teasing, cryptic smile. Could it possibly
      be, he wondered wildly, that she had divined his monstrous impulse, and
      was coquetting with it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s be serious,&rdquo; she said, leading the way back to the lawn. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      like a hanging-garden, high up here, with the meads and the sea below,
      isn&rsquo;t it? And àpropos of the sea, I would beg you to observe its colour.
      Is it blue? I would also ask you kindly to cast an eye on that line of
      cliffs, there to the eastward, as it goes winding in and out away to the
      vanishing point. Are the cliffs white?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, the cliffs are white,&rdquo; agreed the unwary Will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you tell such dreadful fibs?&rdquo; she caught him up. &ldquo;The cliffs are
      prismatic. White, indeed! when they gleam with every transparent tint from
      rose to violet, as if the light that falls on them had passed through
      rubies and amethysts, and all sorts of precious stones. That is an optical
      effect due doubtless to reflection or refraction or something&mdash;no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say it was almost certainly due to something,&rdquo; he acquiesced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;will you obligingly turn your attention to the
      birds? Tweet-weet-willow-will-weet. I don&rsquo;t know what it means, but they
      repeat it so often and so earnestly, I&rsquo;m sure it must be true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s relatively true,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It means that it&rsquo;s a fine morning, and
      their digestion&rsquo;s good, and their affairs are prospering&mdash;nothing
      more than that. They&rsquo;re material-minded little beasts, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All truth is relative,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and one&rsquo;s relatively a material-minded
      little beast oneself. Is the greensward beyond there (relatively) spangled
      with buttercups and daisies? Is the park (relatively) leafy, and shadowy,
      and mysterious, and delightful? Is the may in bloom? <i>Voyons donc!</i>
      you&rsquo;ll never be denying that the may&rsquo;s in bloom. And is the air like an
      elixir? I vow, it goes to one&rsquo;s head like some ethereal elixir. And yet
      you have the effrontery to tell me that you&rsquo;re pining for the flesh-pots
      of Great College Street, Westminster, S.W.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, did I tell you that? Ah, well, it must have been with intent to
      deceive, for nothing could be farther from the truth,&rdquo; he owned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The relative truth? Then you&rsquo;re not homesick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not consciously,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither am I,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you be?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is positively the first day since my arrival in England that I
      haven&rsquo;t been, more or less,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; he wondered sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t think how <i>dépaysée</i> I&rsquo;ve felt. After having lived all
      one&rsquo;s life in Prague, suddenly to find oneself translated to the
      mistress-ship of an English country house,&rdquo; she submitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Prague? I thought you had lived in Rome and Paris, chiefly,&rdquo; he
      exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prague is a figure of rhetoric,&rdquo; she reminded him. &ldquo;I mean the capital of
      Bohemia. Wasn&rsquo;t my father a sculptor? And wasn&rsquo;t I born in a studio? And
      haven&rsquo;t my playmates and companions always been of Florizel the loyal
      subjects? So whether you call it Rome or Paris or Florence or Naples, it
      was Prague, none the less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At that rate, I live in Prague myself, and we&rsquo;re compatriots,&rdquo; said Will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no doubt why I don&rsquo;t feel homesick any more,&rdquo; she responded,
      smiling. &ldquo;Where two of the faithful are gathered together they can form a
      miniature Prague of their own. If I decide to stay in England, I shall
      send for a lot of my Prague friends to come and visit me, and you can send
      for an equal number of yours; and then we&rsquo;ll turn this bright particular
      corner of the British Empire into a province of Bohemia, and the County
      may be horrified with reason. But meanwhile, let&rsquo;s be Pragueians in
      practice as well as theory. Let&rsquo;s go to the strawberry beds, and steal
      some strawberries,&rdquo; was her conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked a little in front of him. Her garden-hat had come off, and she
      was swinging it at her side, by its ribbons. Will noticed the strong,
      lithe sway and rhythm of her body, as she moved. &ldquo;What a <i>woman</i> she
      is,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;how one feels her sex.&rdquo; And with that, he all at once
      became aware of a singular depression. &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; a malevolent little voice
      within him argued, &ldquo;woman that she is, and having passed all her life with
      the subjects of Florizel, surely, surely, she must have had...
      experiences. She must have loved&mdash;she must have been loved.&rdquo; And (as
      if it was any of his business!) a kind of vague jealousy of her past, a
      kind of suspiciousness and irrelevant resentment, began to burn, a small
      dull spot of pain, somewhere in his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, apparently, was in the highest spirits. There was something
      expressive of joyousness in the mere way she tripped over the grass,
      swinging her garden-hat like a basket; and presently she fell to singing,
      merrily, in a light voice, that prettiest of old French songs, <i>Les
      Trots Princesses</i>, dancing forward to its measure:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Derrièr&rsquo; chez mon père,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      (Vole, vole, mon cour, vole!)
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Derrièr&rsquo; chez mon père,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Ya un pommier doux,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Tout doux, et iou,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Ya un pommier doux.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like that song?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;The tune of it is like the smell
      of faded rose-leaves, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly she began to sing a different one, possibly an improvisation:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo; And so they set forth for the strawberry beds,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The strawberry beds, the strawberry beds,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And so they set forth for the strawberry beds,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      On Christmas day in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And when they had reached the strawberry beds, she knelt, and plucked a
      great red berry, and then leapt up again, and held it to her cousin&rsquo;s
      lips, saying, &ldquo;Bite&mdash;but spare my fingers.&rdquo; And so, laughing, she fed
      it to him, while he, laughing too, consumed it. But when her pink
      finger-tips all but touched his lips, his heart had a convulsion, and it
      was only by main-force that he restrained his kisses. And he said to
      himself, &ldquo;I must go back to town to-morrow. This will never do. It would
      be the devil to pay if I should let myself fall in love with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;ve felt terribly <i>dépaysée</i>,&rdquo; she told him again, herself
      nibbling a berry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve felt like the traditional cat in the strange
      garret. And then, besides, there was my change of name. I can&rsquo;t reconcile
      myself to being called Miss Silver. I can&rsquo;t realise the character. It&rsquo;s
      like an affectation, like making-believe. Directly I relax my vigilance, I
      forget, and sink back into Johannah Rothe. I&rsquo;m always Johannah Rothe when
      I&rsquo;m alone. Directly I&rsquo;m alone, I push a big <i>ouf</i>, and send Miss
      Silver to Cracklimbo. Then somebody comes, and, with a weary sigh, I don
      my sheep&rsquo;s clothing again. Of course, there&rsquo;s nothing in a name, and yet
      there&rsquo;s everything. There&rsquo;s a furious amount of mental discomfort when the
      name doesn&rsquo;t fit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a discomfort that will pass,&rdquo; he said consolingly. &ldquo;The change of
      name is a mere formality&mdash;a condition attached to coming into a
      property. In England, you know, it&rsquo;s a rather frequent condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m aware of that,&rdquo; she informed him. &ldquo;But to me,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;it seems
      symbolic&mdash;symbolic of my whole situation, which is false, abnormal.
      Silver? Silver? It&rsquo;s a name meant for a fair person, with light hair and a
      white skin. And here I am, as black as any Gipsy. And then! It&rsquo;s a
      condition attached to coming into a property. Well, I come into a property
      to which I have no more moral right than I have to the coat on your back;
      and I&rsquo;m obliged to do it under an <i>alias</i>, like a thief in the
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear young lady,&rdquo; he cried out, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve the very best of rights,
      moral as well as legal. You come into a property that is left to you by
      will, and you&rsquo;re the last representative of the family in whose hands it
      has been for I forget how many hundreds of years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;is a question I shall not refuse to discuss with you
      upon some more fitting occasion. For the present I am tempted to
      perpetrate a simply villainous pun, but I forbear. Suffice it to say that
      I consider the property that I&rsquo;ve come into as nothing more nor less than
      a present made me by my cousin, William Stretton. No&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      interrupt!&rdquo; she forbade him. &ldquo;I happen to know my facts. I happen to know
      that if Will Stretton hadn&rsquo;t, for reasons in the highest degree honourable
      to himself, quarrelled and broken with his father, and refused to receive
      a penny from him, I happen to know, I say, that Sir William Silver would
      have left Will Stretton everything he possessed in the world. Oh, it&rsquo;s not
      in vain that I&rsquo;ve pumped the man named Burrell. So, you see, I&rsquo;m indebted
      to my Quixotic cousin for something in the neighbourhood, I&rsquo;m told, of
      eight thousand a year. Rather a handsome little present, isn&rsquo;t it?
      Furthermore, let me add in passing, I absolutely forbid my cousin to call
      me his dear young lady, as if he were seven hundred years my senior and
      only a casual acquaintance. A really nice cousin would take the liberty of
      calling me by my Christian name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the liberty of calling you by some exceedingly <i>un</i>Christian
      name,&rdquo; he menaced, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t leave off talking that impossible rot
      about my making you a present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t talking impossible rot about your making me a present,&rdquo; she
      contradicted. &ldquo;I was merely telling you how <i>dépaysée</i> I&rsquo;d felt. The
      rest was parenthetic. So now, then, keep your promise, call me Johannah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johannah,&rdquo; he called, submissively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;And when you feel, Will, that on the whole, Will,
      you&rsquo;ve had strawberries enough, Will, quite to destroy your appetite,
      perhaps it would be as well if we should go in to breakfast, Willie.&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hey were seated on
      the turf, under a great tree, in the park, amid a multitude of
      bright-coloured cushions, Johannah, Will, and Madame Dornaye. It was three
      weeks later&mdash;whence it may be inferred that he had abandoned his
      resolution to &ldquo;go back to town to-morrow.&rdquo; He was smoking a cigarette;
      Madame Dornaye was knitting; Johannah, hatless, in an indescribable
      confection of cream-coloured muslin, her head pillowed in a scarlet
      cushion against the body of the tree, was gazing off towards the sea with
      dreamy eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will,&rdquo; she called languidly, by-and-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you happen by any chance to belong to that sect of philosophers who
      regard gold as a precious metal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the little I&rsquo;ve seen of it, I am inclined to regard it as precious&mdash;yes,&rdquo;
       he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I wouldn&rsquo;t be so lavish of it, if I were you,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t take care,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll force me to admit that I
      haven&rsquo;t an idea of what you&rsquo;re driving at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m driving at your silence. You&rsquo;re as silent as a statue. Please talk a
      little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I talk about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything. Nothing. Tell us a story,&rdquo; she decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any stories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the least you can do is to invent one,&rdquo; was her plausible retort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a story would you like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one sort of story a woman ever sincerely likes&mdash;especially
      on a hot summer&rsquo;s afternoon, in the country,&rdquo; she affirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t possibly invent a love-story,&rdquo; he disclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then tell us a true one. You needn&rsquo;t be afraid of shocking Madame
      Dornaye. She&rsquo;s a realist herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jeanne ma fille!&rdquo; murmured Madame Dornaye, reprovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only true love-story I could tell has a somewhat singular defect,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no heroine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s like the story of what&rsquo;s-his-name&mdash;Narcissus,&rdquo; Johannah said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the vastest difference. The hero of my story wasn&rsquo;t in love with his
      own image. He was in love with a beautiful princess,&rdquo; Will explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how can you have the face to say that there&rsquo;s no heroine?&rdquo; she
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any heroine. At the same time, there&rsquo;s nothing else. The
      story&rsquo;s all about her. You see, she never existed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said it was a <i>true</i> love-story,&rdquo; she reproached him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is&mdash;literally true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked for a story, and you give me a riddle.&rdquo; She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, it&rsquo;s a story all the same,&rdquo; he reassured her. &ldquo;Its title is <i>Much
      Ado about Nobody</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh? It runs in my head that I&rsquo;ve met with something or other with a
      similar title before,&rdquo; she considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Something or other by one of the Elizabethans.
      That&rsquo;s how it came to occur to me. I take my goods where I find them.
      However, do you want to hear the story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if you&rsquo;re determined to tell it, I daresay I can steel myself to
      listen,&rdquo; she answered, with resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On second thoughts, I&rsquo;m determined not to tell it,&rdquo; he teased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bother! Don&rsquo;t be disagreeable. Tell it at once,&rdquo; she commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, there isn&rsquo;t any story,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s simply an absurd
      little freak of child psychology. It&rsquo;s the story of a boy who fell in love
      with a girl&mdash;a girl that never was, on sea or land. It happened in
      Regent Street, of all romantic places, &rsquo;one day still fierce &rsquo;mid many a
      day struck calm.&rsquo; I had gone with my mother to her milliner&rsquo;s. I think I
      was ten or eleven. And while my mother was transacting her business with
      the milliner, I devoted my attention to the various hats and bonnets that
      were displayed about the shop. And presently I hit on one that gave me a
      sensation. It was a straw hat, with brown ribbons, and cherries, great
      glossy red and purple cherries. I looked at it, and suddenly I got a
      vision&mdash;a vision of a girl. Oh, the loveliest, loveliest girl! She
      was about eighteen (a self-respecting boy of eleven, you know, always
      chooses a girl of about eighteen to fall in love with), and she had the
      brightest brown eyes, and the rosiest cheeks, and the curlingest hair, and
      a smile and a laugh that made one&rsquo;s heart thrill and thrill with
      unutterable blisses. And there hung her hat, as if she had just come in
      and taken it off, and passed into another room. There hung her hat,
      suggestive of her as only people&rsquo;s hats know how to be suggestive; and
      there sat I, my eyes devouring it, my soul transported. The very air of
      the shop seemed all at once to have become fragrant&mdash;with the
      fragrance that had been shaken from her garments as she passed. I went
      home, hopelessly, frantically in love. I loved that non-existent young
      woman with a passion past expressing, for at least half a year. I was
      always thinking of her; she was always with me, everywhere. How I used to
      talk to her, and tell her all my childish fancies, desires, questionings;
      how I used to sit at her feet and listen! She never laughed at me.
      Sometimes she would let me kiss her&mdash;I declare, my heart still jumps
      at the memory of it. Sometimes I would hold her hand or play with her
      hair. And all the <i>real</i> girls I met seemed so tame and commonplace
      by contrast with her. And then, little by little, I suppose, her image
      faded away.&mdash;Rather an odd experience, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very, very odd; very strange and very pretty,&rdquo; Johannah murmured. &ldquo;It
      seems as if it ought to have some allegorical significance, though I can&rsquo;t
      perceive one. It would be interesting to know what sort of real girl, if
      any, ended by becoming the owner of that hat. You weren&rsquo;t shocked, were
      you?&rdquo; she inquired of Madame Dornaye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by the story. But the heat is too much for me,&rdquo; said that lady,
      gathering up her knitting. &ldquo;I am going to the house to make a siesta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Will rose, as she did, and stood looking vaguely after her, as she moved
      away. Johannah nestled her head deeper in her cushion, and half closed her
      eyes. And for a while neither she nor her cousin spoke. A faint, faint
      breeze whispered in the tree-tops; now a twig snapped, now a bird dropped
      a solitary liquid note. For the rest, all was still summer heat and
      woodland perfume. Here and there the greensward round them, dark in the
      shadow of dense foliage, was diapered with vivid yellow by sunbeams that
      filtered through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear me,&rdquo; Johannah sighed at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Will demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are, silent as eternity again. Come and sit down&mdash;here&mdash;near
      to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She indicated a position with a lazy movement of her hand. He obediently
      sank upon the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always silent nowadays, when we&rsquo;re alone,&rdquo; she complained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I? I hadn&rsquo;t noticed that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re extremely unobservant. Directly we&rsquo;re alone, you appear to
      lose the power of speech. You mope and moon, and gaze off at things beyond
      the horizon, and never open your mouth. One might suppose you had
      something on your mind. Have you? What is it? Confide it to me, and you
      can&rsquo;t think how relieved you&rsquo;ll feel,&rdquo; she urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t anything on my mind,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh? Ah, then you&rsquo;re silent with me because I bore you? You find me an
      uninspiring talk-mate? Thank you,&rdquo; she bridled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know perfectly well that that&rsquo;s preposterous nonsense,&rdquo; answered
      Will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, what is it? Why do you never talk to me when we&rsquo;re alone?&rdquo;
       she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do talk to you. I talk too much. Perhaps <i>I&rsquo;m</i> afraid of
      boring <i>you</i>,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know perfectly well that that&rsquo;s a preposterous subterfuge,&rdquo; said she.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got something on your mind. You&rsquo;re keeping something back.&rdquo; She
      paused for a second; then, softly, wistfully, &ldquo;Tell me what it is, Will,
      <i>please</i>.&rdquo; And she looked eagerly, pleadingly, into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked away from her. &ldquo;Upon my word, there&rsquo;s nothing to tell,&rdquo; he said,
      but his tone was a little forced.
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke into a merry peal of laughter, looking at him now with eyes that
      were derisive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At you, Will,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;What else could you imagine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m flattered to think you find me so amusing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re supremely amusing. &rsquo;Refrain thou shalt; thou shalt refrain!&rsquo;
      Is that your motto, Will? If I were a man, I&rsquo;d choose another. &rsquo;Be bold,
      be bold, and everywhere be bold!&rsquo; That should be my motto if I were a
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as you&rsquo;re a woman&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my motto, all the same,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;Do you mean to say you&rsquo;ve
      not discovered that yet? Oh, Will, if I were you, and you were I, how
      differently we should be employing this heaven-sent summer&rsquo;s afternoon.&rdquo;
       She gazed at the sky, and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should we be doing?&rdquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a secret. Pray the fairies to-night to transpose our souls, and
      you&rsquo;ll know by to-morrow morning&mdash;if the fairies grant your prayer.
      But in the meanwhile, you must try to entertain me. Tell me another
      story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of any more stories till I&rsquo;ve had my tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shan&rsquo;t have any tea unless you earn it,&rdquo; she stipulated. &ldquo;Now that
      Madame Dornaye&rsquo;s no longer present, you can tell me of some of your
      grown-up love affairs, some of your flesh-and-blood ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had a grown-up love affair,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come! you can&rsquo;t expect me to believe that,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the truth, all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, it&rsquo;s high time you <i>should</i> have one,&rdquo; was her
      conclusion. &ldquo;How old did you say you were?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thirty-three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lifted up her hands in astonishment. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve never had a love
      affair! <i>Fi donc!</i> I&rsquo;m barely twenty-eight, and I&rsquo;ve had a hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; he asked, a little ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t. But everybody&rsquo;s had at least one. So tell me yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, I&rsquo;ve not had even one,&rdquo; he reiterated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems incredible. How have you contrived it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The circumstances of my birth contrived it for me. It would be impossible
      for me to have a love affair with a woman I could love,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible? For goodness sake, why?&rdquo; she wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What woman would accept the addresses of a man without a name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you a name? Methought I&rsquo;d heard your name was William Stretton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then permit me to remark,&rdquo; she answered him, &ldquo;that what you mean is quite
      superlatively silly. If you loved a woman, wouldn&rsquo;t you tell her so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if I could help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose the woman loved you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it wouldn&rsquo;t come to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose it <i>had</i> come to that?&rdquo; she persevered. &ldquo;Suppose she&rsquo;d
      set her heart upon you? Would it be fair to her not to tell her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would be the good of my telling her, since I couldn&rsquo;t possibly ask
      her to marry me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact might interest her, apart from the question of its
      consequences,&rdquo; Johannah suggested. &ldquo;But suppose <i>she</i> told you?
      Suppose <i>she</i> asked <i>you</i> to marry <i>her?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All hypotheses are admissible. Suppose she should?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t marry her,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d find it rather an awkward job refusing, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she quizzed.
      &ldquo;And what reasons could you give?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten thousand reasons. I&rsquo;m a bastard. That begins and ends it. It would
      dishonour her, and it would dishonour me; and, worst of all, it would
      dishonour my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would certainly <i>not</i> dishonour you, nor the woman you married.
      That&rsquo;s the sheerest, antiquated, exploded rubbish. And how on earth could
      it dishonour your mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me to take as my wife a woman who could not respect her?&rdquo; Will
      questioned. &ldquo;My mother&rsquo;s memory for me is the sacredest of sacred things.
      You know something of her history. You know that she was in every sense
      but a legal sense my father&rsquo;s wife. You know why they couldn&rsquo;t be married
      legally. You know, too, how he treated her&mdash;and how she died. Do you
      suppose I could marry a woman who would always think of my mother as of
      one who had done something shameful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but no woman with a spark of nobility in her soul would or could do
      that,&rdquo; Johannah cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every woman brought up in the usual way, with the usual prejudices, the
      usual traditions, thinks evil of the woman who has had an illegitimate
      child,&rdquo; asserted he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not every woman. I, for instance. Do you imagine that I could think evil
      of your mother, Will?&rdquo; She looked at him intensely, earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re entirely different from other women. You&rsquo;re&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; But
      he stopped at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;just for the sake of a case in point&mdash;if <i>I</i> were
      the woman you chanced to be in love with, and if I simultaneously chanced
      to be in love with you, you <i>could</i> see your way to marrying <i>me?</i>&rdquo;
       she pursued him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of discussing that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For its metaphysical interest. Answer me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are other reasons why I couldn&rsquo;t marry <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not good-looking enough?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not young enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say! Let&rsquo;s talk of something reasonable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not old enough, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not wise enough? Not foolish enough?&rdquo; she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re foolish enough, in all conscience,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Well, then, why?
      What are the reasons why you couldn&rsquo;t marry <i>me?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>is</i> the good of talking about this?&rdquo; he groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know. A man has the hardihood to inform me to my face that he&rsquo;d
      spurn my hand, even if I offered it to him. I insist upon knowing why.&rdquo;
       She feigned high indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know why. And you know that &rsquo;spurn&rsquo; is very far from the right word,&rdquo;
       was his rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why. I insist upon your telling me,&rdquo; she repeated, fierily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that you&rsquo;re Sir William Silver&rsquo;s heiress, I suppose,&rdquo; he
      suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come! that&rsquo;s not <i>my</i> fault. How could <i>that</i> matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, I&rsquo;m not going to make an ass of myself by explaining the
      obvious,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay I&rsquo;m very stupid, but it isn&rsquo;t obvious to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, let&rsquo;s drop the subject,&rdquo; he proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not drop the subject till you&rsquo;ve elucidated it. If you were in love
      with me, Will, and I were in love with you, how on earth could it matter,
      my being Sir William Silvers heiress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t I seem a bit mercenary&rsquo; if I asked you to marry me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Will!&rdquo; she remonstrated. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;re such a prig as that.
      What! if you loved me, if I loved you, you&rsquo;d give me up, you&rsquo;d break my
      heart, just for fear lest idiotic people, whose opinions don&rsquo;t matter any
      more than the opinions of so many deep-sea fish, might think you
      mercenary! When you and I both knew in our own two souls that you really
      weren&rsquo;t mercenary&rsquo; in the least! You&rsquo;d pay me a poor compliment, Will.
      Isn&rsquo;t it conceivable that a man might love me for myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You state the case too simply. You make no allowances for the shades and
      complexities of a man&rsquo;s feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bother shades and complexities. Love burns them up. Your shades and
      complexities are nothing but priggishness and vanity,&rdquo; she asserted hotly.
      &ldquo;But there! I&rsquo;m actually getting angry over a purely supposititious
      question. For, of course, we don&rsquo;t really love each other the least bit,
      do we, Will?&rdquo; she asked him softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He appeared to be giving his whole attention to the rolling of a
      cigarette; he did not answer. But his fingers trembled, and presently he
      tore his paper, spilling half the tobacco in his lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johannah watched him from eyes full of languid, half mocking, half pensive
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, oh, dear,&rdquo; she sighed again, by-and-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her; and he had to catch his breath. Lying there on the turf,
      the skirts of her frock flowing round her in a sort of little billowy
      white pool, her head deep in the scarlet cushion, her black hair straying
      wantonly where it would about her face and brow, her eyes lambent with
      that lazy, pensive laughter, one of her hands, pink and white, warm and
      soft, fallen open on the grass between her and her cousin, her whole
      person seeming to breathe a subtle scent of womanhood, and the luxury and
      mystery of womanhood&mdash;oh, the sight of her, the sense of her, there
      in the wide green stillness of the summer day, set his heart burning and
      beating poignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, oh, dear,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;I wish the man I <i>am</i> in love with
      were only here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! You <i>are</i> in love with some one?&rdquo; he questioned, with a little
      start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;In love! I should think so. Oh, I love him, love him,
      love him. Ah, if he were here! <i>He</i> wouldn&rsquo;t waste this golden
      afternoon as you&rsquo;re doing. He&rsquo;d take my hand&mdash;he&rsquo;d hold it, and press
      it, and kiss it; and he&rsquo;d pour his soul out in tumultuous celebration of
      my charms, in fiery avowals of his passion. If he were here! Ah, me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; Will asked, in a dry&rsquo; voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, where indeed? I wish I knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard you speak of him before,&rdquo; he reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s none so deaf as he that <i>will</i> not hear. I&rsquo;ve spoken of him
      to you at least a thousand times. He forms the staple of my conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be veryy deaf indeed. I swear this is absolutely news to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Will, you <i>are</i> such a goose&mdash;or such a hypocrite,&rdquo; said
      she. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s tea-time. Help me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand, and, he took it and helped her up. But she tottered
      a little before she got her balance (or made, at least, a feint of doing
      so), and grasped his hand tight as if to save herself, and all but fell
      into his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew back a step.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked straight into his eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a goose, and a hypocrite, and a
      prig, and&mdash;a <i>dear</i>,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <h3>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>heir tea was
      served in the garden, and whilst they were dallying over it, a footman
      brought Johannah a visiting-card.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at the card; and Will, watching her, noticed that a look of
      annoyance&mdash;it might even have been a look of distress&mdash;came into
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she threw the card on the tea-table, and rose. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be gone
      long,&rdquo; she said, and set out for the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The card lay plainly legible under the eyes of Will and Madame Dornaye.
      &ldquo;Mr. George Aymer, 36, Boulevard Rochechouart&rdquo; was the legend inscribed
      upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tiens</i>,&rdquo; said Madame Dornaye; &ldquo;Jeanne told me she had ceased to see
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Will suppressed a desire to ask, &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Madame Dornaye answered him all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard of him? He is a known personage in Paris, although
      English. He is a painter, a painter of great talent; very young, but
      already decorated. And of a surprising beauty&mdash;the face of an angel.
      With that, a thorough-paced rascal. Oh, yes, whatever is vilest, whatever
      is basest. Even in Montmartre, even in the corruptest world of Paris,
      among the lowest journalists and painters, he is notorious for his
      corruption. Johannah used to see a great deal of him. She would not
      believe the evil stories that were told about him. And with his rare
      talent and his beautiful face, he has the most plausible manners, the most
      winning address. We were afraid that she might end by marrying him. But at
      last she found him out for herself, and gave him up. She told me she had
      altogether ceased to see him. I wonder what ill wind blows him here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johannah entered the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man in grey tweeds, the red ribbon of the Legion of Honour gleaming in
      his buttonhole, was standing near a window: a man, indeed, as Madame
      Dornaye had described him, with a face of surprising beauty&mdash;a fine,
      clear, open-air complexion, a clean-cut, even profile, a sensitive, soft
      mouth, big, frank, innocent blue eyes, and waving hair of the palest Saxon
      yellow. He could scarcely have been thirty; and the exceeding beauty of
      his face, its beauty and its sweetness, made one overlook his figure,
      which was a trifle below the medium height, and thick-set, with remarkably
      square, broad shoulders, and long arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johannah greeted him with some succinctness. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she
      asked, remaining close to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to have a talk with you,&rdquo; he answered, moving towards her. He
      drawled slightly; his voice was low and soft, conciliatory, caressing
      almost. And his big blue eyes shone with a faint, sweet, appealing smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you mind staying where you are?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You can make yourself
      audible from across the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you afraid of?&rdquo; he asked, his smile brightening with innocent
      wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid? You do yourself too much honour. One does not like to find
      oneself in close proximity with objects that disgust one,&rdquo; she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed; but instead of moving further towards her, he dropped into a
      chair. &ldquo;You were always brutally outspoken,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and with advancing years I&rsquo;ve become even more so,&rdquo; said Johannah,
      who continued to stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite sure, though, that you&rsquo;re not afraid of me?&rdquo; he questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for that, as sure as sure can be. If you&rsquo;ve based any sort of
      calculations upon the theory that I would be afraid of you, you&rsquo;ll have to
      throw them over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flushed a little, as if with anger; but in a moment he said calmly,
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come into a perfect pot of money since I last had the pleasure of
      meeting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, into something like eight thousand a year, if the figures interest
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never had any head for figures,&rdquo; he answered, smiling. &ldquo;But eight
      thousand sounds stupendous. And a lovely place, into the bargain. The
      park, or so much of it as one sees from the avenue, could not be better.
      And I permitted myself to admire the façade of the house and the view of
      the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not bad,&rdquo; Johannah assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s heart-rending,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;the way things are shared in this
      world. Here are you, rich beyond the dreams of avarice, you who have done
      nothing all your life but take your pleasure; and I, who&rsquo;ve toiled like a
      galley-slave, I remain as poor as any church-mouse. It&rsquo;s monstrous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johannah did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ve settled down and become
      respectable? No more Bohemia? No more cakes and ale? Only champagne and
      truffles? A County Family! Fancy your being a County Family, all by
      yourself, as it were! You must feel rather like the reformed rake of
      tradition&mdash;don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mentioned that I am not afraid of you,&rdquo; she reminded him, &ldquo;but that
      doesn&rsquo;t in the least imply that I find you amusing. The plain truth is, I
      find you deadly tiresome. If you have anything special to say to me, may I
      ask you to say it quickly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he flushed a little; then again, in a moment, answered smoothly,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it in a sentence. I&rsquo;ve come all the way to England, for the
      purpose of offering you my hand in marriage.&rdquo; And he raised his bright
      blue eyes to her face with a look that really was seraphic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I decline the offer. If you&rsquo;ve nothing further to keep you here, I&rsquo;ll
      ring to have you shown out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still again he flushed, yet once more controlled himself. &ldquo;You decline the
      offer! <i>Allons donc!</i> When I am prepared to do the right thing, and
      make an honest woman of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I decline the offer,&rdquo; Johannah repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s foolish of you,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you could dream how remotely your opinion interests me, you wouldn&rsquo;t
      trouble to express it,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      His anger this time got the better of him. He scowled, and looked at her
      from the corners of his eyes. &ldquo;You had better not exasperate me,&rdquo; he said
      in a suppressed voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you must suffer me to be the mistress of my own actions
      in my own house. Now&mdash;if you are quite ready to go?&rdquo; she suggested,
      putting her hand upon the bell-cord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not ready to go yet. I want to talk with you. To cut a long business
      short, you&rsquo;re rich. I&rsquo;m pitiably poor. You know how poor I am. You know
      how I have to live, the hardships, the privations I&rsquo;m obliged to put up
      with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you come here to beg?&rdquo; Johannah asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve come to appeal to your good-nature. You refuse to marry me.
      That&rsquo;s absurd of you, but&mdash;<i>tant pis!</i> Whether you marry me or
      not, you haven&rsquo;t the heart to leave me to rot in poverty, while you
      luxuriate in plenty. Considering our oldtime relations, the thing&rsquo;s
      impossible on the face of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I understand. You <i>have</i> come here to beg,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;One begs when one has no power to enforce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the use of these glittering aphorisms?&rdquo; she asked wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are ready to behave well to me, I&rsquo;ll behave handsomely to you. But
      if you refuse to recognise my claims upon you, I&rsquo;m in a position to take
      reprisals,&rdquo; he said very quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johannah did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m miserably, tragically poor; you&rsquo;re rich. At this moment I&rsquo;ve not got
      ten pounds in the world; and I owe hundreds. I&rsquo;ve not sold a picture since
      March. You have eight thousand a year. You can&rsquo;t expect me to sit down
      under it in silence. As the French attorneys phrase it, <i>cet état de
      choses ne peut pas durer</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Johannah answered nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must come to my relief,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You must make it possible for me
      to go on. If you have any right feeling, you&rsquo;ll do it spontaneously. If
      not&mdash;you know I can compel you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then, for goodness&rsquo; sake, compel me, and so make an end of this
      entirely tedious visit,&rdquo; she broke out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d immensely rather not compel you. If you will lend me a helping hand
      from time to time, I&rsquo;ll promise never to take a step to harm you. I shall
      be moderate. You&rsquo;ve got eight thousand a year. You&rsquo;d never miss a hundred
      now and then. You might simply occasionally buy a picture. That would be
      the best way. You might buy my pictures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be glad to know definitely,&rdquo; remarked Johannah, &ldquo;whether I have
      to deal with a blackmailer or a bagman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn you,&rdquo; he exploded, with sudden savagery, flushing very red indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johannah was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a pause, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m staying at the inn in the village&mdash;at
      the Silver Arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johannah did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already scraped acquaintance with the parson,&rdquo; he went on. Then, as
      she still was silent, &ldquo;I wonder what would become of your social position
      in this County if I should have a good long talk about you with the
      parson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a man of your intelligence, the solution of that problem can surely
      present no difficulty,&rdquo; she replied wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You admit that your social position would be smashed up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the king&rsquo;s horses and all the king&rsquo;s men couldn&rsquo;t put it together
      again,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to find at least that you acknowledge my power,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have it in your power to tell people that I was once inconceivably
      simple enough to believe that you were an honourable man, that I once had
      the inconceivable bad taste to be fond of you. What woman&rsquo;s character
      could survive <i>that</i> revelation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I could add&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t I?&mdash;that you once had the
      inconceivable weakness to become my mistress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you could add no end of details,&rdquo; she admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then?&rdquo; he questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then?&rdquo; questioned she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It comes to this, that if you don&rsquo;t want your social position, your
      reputation, to be utterly smashed up, you must make terms with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little unfortunate, from that way of looking at it,&rdquo; she pointed
      out, &ldquo;that I shouldn&rsquo;t happen to care a rush about my social position&mdash;as
      you call it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll have a good long talk with the parson,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do by all means,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better be careful. I may take you at your word,&rdquo; he threatened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would. Take me at my word&mdash;-and go,&rdquo; she urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say you seriously don&rsquo;t care?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a rush, not a button,&rdquo; she assured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come! You&rsquo;ll never try to brazen the thing out,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d go and have your long talk with the parson,&rdquo; she said
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be so easy for you to give me a little help,&rdquo; he pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be so easy for you to &rsquo;smash up&rsquo; my reputation with the parson,&rdquo;
       she rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never used to be close-fisted. It&rsquo;s incomprehensible that you should
      refuse me a little help. Look. I&rsquo;m willing to be more than fair. Give me a
      hundred pounds, a bare little hundred pounds, and I&rsquo;ll send you a lovely
      picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, I don&rsquo;t want a picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t give me a hundred pounds&mdash;a beggarly hundred pounds?&rdquo; He
      looked incredulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t give you a farthing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, by God, you jade,&rdquo; he cried, springing to his feet, his face
      crimson, &ldquo;by God, I&rsquo;ll make you. I swear I&rsquo;ll ruin you. Look out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you really going at last?&rdquo; she asked brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not going till it suits my pleasure. You&rsquo;ve got a sort of bastard
      cousin staying here with you, I&rsquo;m told,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would advise you to moderate your tone or your language,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;If
      my sort of bastard cousin should by any chance happen to hear you
      referring to him in those terms, he would not be pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see him,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would advise you not to see him,&rdquo; she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see him,&rdquo; he insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you really wish to see him, I&rsquo;ll send for him,&rdquo; she consented. &ldquo;But
      it&rsquo;s only right to warn you that he&rsquo;s not at all a patient sort of man. If
      I send for him, he will quite certainly make things disagreeable for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of him. You know well enough that I&rsquo;m not a coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My cousin is more than a head taller than you are,&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;He would
      be perfectly able and perfectly sure to kick you. If there&rsquo;s any other
      possible way of getting rid of you, I&rsquo;d rather not trouble him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I had better have a talk with your cousin, as well as with the
      parson,&rdquo; he considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you had better confine your attentions to the parson. I do, upon
      my word,&rdquo; she counselled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to make a concession,&rdquo; said Aymer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give you a
      night in which to think this thing over. If you care to send me a note,
      with a cheque in it, so that I shall receive it at the inn by to-morrow at
      ten o&rsquo;clock, I&rsquo;ll take the next earliest train back to town, and I&rsquo;ll send
      you a picture in return. If no note comes by ten o&rsquo;clock, I&rsquo;ll call on the
      parson, and tell him all I know about you; and I&rsquo;ll write a letter to your
      cousin. Now, good day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johannah rang, and Aymer was shown out.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VI
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;|I shan&rsquo;t be gone long,&rdquo; Johannah had said, when she left Madame Dornaye
      and Will at tea in the garden; but time passed, and she did not come back.
      Will, mounting through various stages and degrees of nervousness,
      restlessness, anxiety, at last said, &ldquo;What on earth can be keeping her?&rdquo;
       and Madame Dornaye replied, &ldquo;That is precisely what I am asking myself.&rdquo;
       They waited a little longer, and then, &ldquo;Shall we go back to the house?&rdquo; he
      suggested. But when they reached the house they found the drawing-room
      empty, and&mdash;no trace of Johannah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may be in her room. I&rsquo;ll go and see,&rdquo; said Madame Dornaye.
    </p>
    <p>
      More time passed, and still no Johannah. Nor did Madame Dornaye return to
      explain her absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will walked about in a state of acute misery. What could it be? What could
      have happened? What could this painter, this George Aymer, this
      thorough-paced rascal with the beautiful face, this man of whom Johannah,
      in days gone by, &ldquo;had seen a great deal,&rdquo; so that her friends had feared
      &ldquo;she might end by marrying him&rdquo;&mdash;what could he have called upon her
      for? What could have passed between them? Why had she disappeared? Where
      was she now? Where was he? Where was Madame Dornaye, who had gone to look
      for her? Could&mdash;could it possibly be&mdash;that he&mdash;this man
      notorious for his corruption even in the corruptest world of Paris&mdash;could
      it be that he was the man Johannah meant when she had talked of the man
      she was in love with? And Will, fatuous imbecile, had vainly allowed
      himself to imagine.... Oh, why did she not come back? What <i>could</i> be
      keeping her away from him all this time?... &ldquo;I have had a hundred, I have
      had a hundred.&rdquo; The phrase echoed and echoed in his memory. She had said,
      &ldquo;I have had a hundred love affairs.&rdquo; Oh, to be sure, in the next breath,
      she had contradicted herself, she had said, &ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo; But she had
      added, &ldquo;Everybody has had at least one.&rdquo; So she had had at least one. With
      this man, George Aymer? Madame Dornaye said she had broken with him,
      ceased to see him. But&mdash;it was certain she had seen him to-day. But&mdash;lovers&rsquo;
      quarrels are made up; lovers break with each other, and then come together
      again, are reunited. Perhaps... Perhaps... Oh, where was she? Why did she
      remain away in this mysterious fashion? What could she be doing? What
      could she be doing?
    </p>
    <p>
      The dressing-bell rang, and he went to dress for dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow, I shall see her now, I shall see her at dinner,&rdquo; he kept telling
      himself, as he dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he came downstairs the drawing-room was still empty. He walked
      backwards and forwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall have to dine without our hostess,&rdquo; Madame Dornaye said, entering
      presently. &ldquo;Jeanne has a bad headache, and will stay in her room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      VII
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ill left the house
      early the next morning, and went out into the garden. The sun was shining,
      the dew sparkled on the grass, the air was keen and sweet with the odours
      of the earth. A mile away the sea glowed blue as larkspur; and overhead
      innumerable birds gaily piped and twittered. But oh, the difference, the
      difference! His eyes could see no colour, his ears could hear no music.
      His brain felt as if it had been stretched and strained, like a thing of
      india-rubber; a lump ached in his throat; his heart was sick with the
      suspense of waiting, with the questionings, the fears, suspicions, that
      had beset it through the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will!&rdquo; Johannah&rsquo;s voice called behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; The words came without conscious volition on his part. &ldquo;I
      thought I was never going to see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been waiting for you,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wore her garden-hat and her white frock; but her face was pale, and
      her eyes looked dark and anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had taken her hand, and was clinging to it, pressing it, hard, so hard
      that it must have hurt her, in the violence of his emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, wait, Will, wait,&rdquo; she said, trying to draw her hand away; and her
      eyes filled with sudden tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      He let go her hand, and looked into her tearful eyes, helpless,
      speechless, longing to speak, unable, in the confusion of his thoughts and
      feelings, to find a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must tell you something, Will. Come with me somewhere&mdash;where we
      can be alone. I must tell you something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved off, away from the house, he keeping beside her. They passed out
      of the garden, into the deep shade of the park.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Do</i> you remember,&rdquo; she began, all at once, &ldquo;do you remember what I
      said yesterday, about my motto? That my motto was &rsquo;Be bold, be bold, and
      everywhere be bold&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to be very bold indeed now, Will. I am going to tell you
      something&mdash;something that will make you hate me perhaps&mdash;that
      will make you despise me perhaps,&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could not possibly tell me anything that could make me hate you or
      despise you. But you must not tell me anything at all, unless it is
      something you are perfectly sure you will be happier for having told me,&rdquo;
       he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is something I wish to tell you, something I must tell you,&rdquo; said she.
      Then after a little pause, &ldquo;Oh, how shall I begin it?&rdquo; But before he could
      have spoken, &ldquo;Do you think that a woman&mdash;do you think that a girl,
      when she is very young, when she is very immature and impressionable, and
      very impulsive, and ignorant, and when she is alone in the world, without
      a father or mother&mdash;do you think that if she makes some terrible
      mistake, if she is terribly deceived, if somebody whom she believes to be
      good and noble and unhappy and misunderstood, somebody whom she&mdash;whom
      she loves&mdash;do you think that if she makes some terrible mistake&mdash;if
      she&mdash;if she&mdash;oh, my God!&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo; She held her
      breath for a second, then suddenly, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you understand what I <i>mean?</i>&rdquo;
       she broke down in a sort of wail, and hid her face in her hands, and
      sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will stood beside her, holding his arms out towards her. &ldquo;Johannah!
      Johannah!&rdquo; was all he could say.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dropped her hands, and looked at him with great painful eyes. &ldquo;Tell me&mdash;do
      you think that a woman can never be forgiven? Do you think that she is
      soiled, degraded, changed utterly? Do you think that when she&mdash;that
      when she did what she did&mdash;it was a sin, a crime, not only a terrible
      mistake, and that her whole nature is changed? Most people think so. They
      think that a mark has been left upon her, branded upon her; that she can
      never, never be the same again. Do you think so, Will? Oh, it is not true;
      I know it is not true. A woman can leave that mistake, that terror, that
      horror&mdash;she can leave it behind her as completely as she can leave
      any other dreadful thing. She can blot it out of her life, like a
      nightmare. She <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> changed&mdash;she remains the same woman. She
      isn&rsquo;t utterly changed, and soiled, and defiled. In her own conscience, no
      matter what other people think, she knows, she knows she isn&rsquo;t. When she
      wakes up to find that the man she had believed in, the man she had loved,
      when she wakes up to find that he isn&rsquo;t in any way what she had thought
      him, that he is base and evil and ignoble, and when all her love for him
      dies in horror and misery&mdash;oh, do you think that she must never,
      never, as long as she lives, hold up her head again, never be happy again,
      never love any one again? Look at me, Will. I am myself. I am what God
      made me. Do you think that I am utterly vile because&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       But her voice failed again, and her eyes again filled with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Johannah, don&rsquo;t ask me what I think of you. I could not tell you what
      I think of you. You are as God made you. God never made&mdash;never made
      any one else so splendid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in a moment his arms were round her, and she was weeping her heart out
      on his shoulder.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ould Madame like a
      little orange-flower water in her milk?&rdquo; the waiter asked. Madame thought
      she would, and the waiter went off to fetch it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were seated on the terrace of a café at Rouen, a café on the quays.
      There was a long rank, three deep, of small marble tables, untenanted for
      the most part, sheltered by a bright red-and-white striped awning, and
      screened from the street by a hedge of oleanders in big green-painted
      tubs; so that one had a fine sense of cosiness and seclusion, of
      refreshing shade and coolness and repose. Beyond the oleanders, one was
      dimly conscious of hot sunshine, of the going and coming of people on the
      pavement, of the passing of carts and tram-cars in the grey road, and then
      of the river&mdash;the slate-coloured river, with its bridges and its
      puffing penny steamboats, its tall ships out of Glasgow or Copenhagen or
      Barcelona, its high green banks, farther away, where it wound into the
      country, and the pure sky above it. From all the interesting things the
      café provided, lucent-tinted syrups, fiery-hearted, aromatic cordials,
      Madame (with subtle feminine unexpectedness) had chosen a glass of milk.
      But the waiter had suggested orange-flower water, to give it savour; and
      now he brought the orange-flower water in a dark-blue bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was partly, I daresay, the sight of the dark-blue bottle, but it was
      chiefly, perhaps, the smell of the orange-flower water, that suddenly,
      suddenly, whisked my thoughts far away from Rouen, far away from 1897,
      back ten, twenty, I would rather not count how many years back in the
      past, to my childhood, to Saint-Graal, and to my grandmother&rsquo;s room in our
      old rambling house there. For my grandmother always kept a dark-blue
      bottle of orange-flower water in her closet, and the air of her room was
      always faintly sweet with the perfume of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, suddenly, a sort of ghost of my grandmother&rsquo;s room rose before
      me; and as I peered into it and about it, a ghost of the old emotion her
      room used to stir in me rose too, an echo of the old wonder, the old
      feeling of strangeness and mystery. It was a big room&mdash;or, at least,
      it seemed big to a child&mdash;a corner room, on the first floor, with
      windows on two sides. The windows on one side looked through the branches
      of a great elm, a city of birds and squirrels, out upon the lawn, with the
      pond at the bottom of it. On the other side, the windows looked over the
      terrace, into the shrubberies and winding paths of the garden. The walls
      of the room were hung with white paper, upon which, at regular intervals,
      was repeated a landscape in blue, a stretch of meadow with cows in it, and
      a hillside topped by a ruined castle. In a corner, the inmost corner,
      stood my grandmother&rsquo;s four-post bed, with its canopy and curtains of
      dark-green tapestry. Then, of course, there was the fireplace, surmounted
      by a high, slender mantelpiece, on which were ranged a pair of silver
      candlesticks, a silver tray containing the snuffers and the extinguisher,
      and, in the middle, a solemn old buhl clock. From above the mantelpiece a
      picture looked down at you, the only picture in the room, the life-size
      portrait of a gentleman in a white stock and an embroidered waistcoat&mdash;the
      portrait of my grandfather, indeed, who had died long years before I was
      born, when my mother was a schoolgirl. And then there was the rest of the
      furniture of the room&mdash;a chair at each window, and between the
      various windows my grandmother&rsquo;s dressing-table, her work-table, her
      armoire-à-glace, her great mahogany bureau, a writing-desk above, a
      chest-of-drawers below. In two or three places&mdash;besides the big
      double door that led into her room from the outer passage&mdash;the wall
      was broken by smaller doors, doors papered over like the wall itself, and
      even with it, so that you would scarcely have noticed them. One of these
      was the door of my grandmother&rsquo;s oratory, with its praying-desk and its
      little altar. The others were the doors of her closets: the deep black
      closet, where her innumerable dresses were suspended, and the closets
      where she kept her bandboxes and her sunshades and her regiment of bottles&mdash;chief
      among them the tall dark-blue bottle of orange-flower water.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t know, I can&rsquo;t think, why this room should always have awakened in
      me a feeling of strangeness and mystery, why it should always have set me
      off day-dreaming and wondering; but it always did. The mahogany bureau,
      the tapestried four-post bed, the portrait of my grandfather, the
      recurrent landscape on the wall-paper, the deep black closet where the
      dresses hung, the faint smell of orange-flower water&mdash;each of these
      was a surface, a curtain, behind which, on the impenetrable other side of
      which, vaguely, wonderingly, I divined strange vistas, a whole strange
      world. Each of these silently hinted to me of strange happenings, strange
      existences, strange conditions. And vaguely, longingly, I would try to
      formulate my feeling into some sort of distinct mental vision, try to
      translate into my own language their occult suggestions. They were
      hieroglyphs, full of meaning, if only I could understand. Was it because
      the things in my grandmother&rsquo;s room were all old things, old-fashioned
      things? Was the strange world they spoke of simply the world as it had
      been in years gone by, before I came into it, before even my mother and
      father came into it, when people long since dead were alive, important,
      the people of the day, and when these faded, old-fashioned things were
      fresh and new? I doubt if it could have been entirely this. There were
      plenty of old things in our house at Saint-Graal&mdash;in the hall, the
      library, the garret, everywhere; the house itself was very old indeed; yet
      no other part of it gave me anything like the same emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Uncle Edmond&rsquo;s room, for instance, gave me a directly contrary emotion,
      though here, too, all the furniture was old-fashioned. It gave me a sense
      of brisk, almost of stern, actuality; of present facts and occupations; of
      alert, busy manhood. As I followed Alexandre into it, in the morning, when
      he went to dust it and put it in order, I was filled with a kind of
      fearful admiration: the fear, the admiration, of the small for the big, of
      the weak for the strong, of the helpless for the commanding. The
      arrangement of the room, the lines of the room, the very colours of the
      room, seemed strong, and commanding, and severe. Yet, when you came to
      examine it, the only really severe-looking object was the bedstead; this
      being devoid of curtains, its four varnished pillars shone somewhat hard
      and bare. For the rest, there was just the natural furniture of a
      sleeping-room: a dressing-table, covered with a man&rsquo;s toilet accessories&mdash;combs
      and brushes, razors, scissors, shoehorns, button-hooks, shirt-studs, and
      bottles enclosing I know not what necessary fluids; a bigger table, with
      writing-materials on it, with an old epaulette-box used now to hold
      tobacco, and endless pipes and little pink books of cigarette-papers; a
      bureau like my grandmother&rsquo;s; a glazed bookcase; and the proper complement
      of chairs. The walls of the room were painted white, and ornamented by two
      pictures, facing each other: two steel-engravings, companion-pieces, after
      Rembrandt, I believe. &ldquo;Le Philosophe en Contemplation&rdquo; was the legend
      printed under one; and under the other, &ldquo;Le Philosophe en Méditation.&rdquo; I
      can only remember that the philosopher had a long grey beard, and that in
      both pictures he was seated in a huge easy-chair. My Uncle Edmond had been
      in the army when he was a young man, and in his closets (besides his
      ordinary clothes and his countless pairs of boots) there were old uniform
      coats, with silver buttons, old belts, clasps, spurs, and then, best of
      all, three or four swords, and a rosewood case or two of pistols. Needless
      to say whether my awe and my admiration mounted to their climax when I
      peeped in upon these historic trophies. And just as the smell of
      orange-flower water pervaded my grandmother&rsquo;s room, so another, a very
      different smell, pervaded my Uncle Edmond&rsquo;s, a dry, clean smell, slightly
      pungent, bitter, but not at all unpleasant. I could never discover what it
      came from, I can&rsquo;t even now conjecture; but it seemed to me a manly smell,
      just the smell that a man&rsquo;s room ought to have. In my too-fruitless
      efforts to imitate Uncle Edmond&rsquo;s room in the organisation of my own, it
      was that smell, more than anything else, which baffled me. I could not
      achieve the remotest semblance of it. Of course, I was determined that
      when I grew up I should have a room exactly like my uncle&rsquo;s in every
      particular, and I trusted, no doubt, that it would acquire the smell, with
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of all the rooms at Saint-Graal, the one that gave you the
      thrillingest, the most exquisite emotion, was my mother&rsquo;s. If my
      grandmother&rsquo;s room represented the silence and the strangeness of the
      past, and my uncle&rsquo;s the actuality and activity of the present, my
      mother&rsquo;s room represented the Eternal Feminine, smiling at you,
      enthralling you, in its loveliest incarnation; singing to you, amid
      delicate luxuries, of youth and beauty and happiness, and the fine romance
      of mirth. In my mother&rsquo;s room, for example, so far from being
      old-fashioned, the furniture was of the very latest, daintiest design,
      fresh from Paris. The wallpaper was cream-coloured, with garlands of pink
      and blue flowers trailing over it, and here and there a shepherd&rsquo;s hat and
      a shepherd&rsquo;s pipes tied together by a long fluttering blue ribbon. The
      chairs and the sofa were covered with chintz, gayer even, if that were
      possible, than this paper: chintz on which pretty little bright-blue birds
      flew about among poppies, red as scarlet, and pale-green leaves. The
      window-curtains and the bed-curtains were of the same merry chintz; the
      bed-quilt was an eider-down of the softest blush-rose silk; the bedstead
      was enamelled white, and so highly polished that you could see an obscure
      reflection of your features in it. And then, the dressing-table, with its
      wide bevelled mirror, and the glistening treasures displayed upon it!&mdash;the
      open jewel-case, and the rings, brooches, bracelets, necklaces, that
      sparkled in it; the silver-backed brushes, the silver-topped bottles, the
      silver-framed hand-glass; the hundred shining trifles. One whole side of
      the room had been converted into a vast bay-window; this looked due south,
      over the floweriest part of our flower-garden, over the rich green country
      beyond, miles away, to where the Pyrenees gloomed purple. As a shield
      against the sun the window was fitted with Venetian blinds, besides the
      curtains; and every morning, when I crept in from my own adjoining room,
      to pay my mother a visit, it was given me to witness a marvellous
      transformation scene. At first all was dark, or nearly dark, so that you
      could only distinguish things as shadowy masses. But presently my mother&rsquo;s
      maid, Aurélie, arrived with the chocolate, and drew back the curtains,
      filling the room with a momentary twilight; then she opened the Venetian
      blinds, and suddenly there was a gush of sunlight, and the room gleamed
      and glittered like a room in a crystal palace. Sweet airs came in from the
      garden, bird-notes came in, the day came in, dancing and laughing
      joyously; and my mother and I joyously laughed back at it. Another
      transformation scene, at which I was permitted to assist, took place in
      this room in the evening, when my mother dressed for dinner. I would sit
      at a distance, not to be in the way, and watch the ceremony with eyes as
      round as O&rsquo;s doubtless, and certainly with an enravished soul; while
      Aurélie did my mother&rsquo;s hair (sprinkling it, as a culmination, with a
      pinch of diamond-dust, according to the mode of the period), and moved to
      and from the wardrobe, where my mother&rsquo;s bewildering confections of silks
      and laces were enshrined, and her satin slippers glimmered in a row on
      their shelf. And after the toilet was completed, and my mother, in
      dazzling loveliness, had kissed me good-bye and vanished, I would linger a
      little, to gaze about the temple in which such miracles could happen;
      taking up and studying one by one the combs, brushes, powder-puffs, or
      what not, as you would study the instruments employed by a conjurer; and
      removing the stoppers from the scent-bottles, to inhale their delicious
      fragrance....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; asked my companion, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s time you paid the waiter
      and we were off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked up, and suddenly there was Rouen&mdash;Rouen, the café on the
      quays, Madame&rsquo;s empty glass of milk, and Madame herself questioning me
      from anxious eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time we were off; and what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;ll tell
      you this: every room in the universe has not only its peculiar physiognomy
      and its peculiar significance, but it wakes a particular sentiment also,
      and has a special smell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; said Madame; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ve been silent all this while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I paid the waiter, and we took the puffing little steamboat, down the
      river, between its green banks and its flowery islets, back to La Bouille.

      ROSEMARY FOR REMEMBRANCE

      I
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> wonder why I
      dreamed last night of Zabetta. It is years since she made her brief little
      transit through my life, and passed out of it utterly. It is years since
      the very recollection of her&mdash;which for years, like an accusing
      spirit, had haunted me too often&mdash;like a spirit was laid. It is long
      enough, in all conscience, since I have even thought of her, casually, for
      an instant. And then, last night, after a perfectly usual London day and
      evening, I went to bed and dreamed of her vividly. What had happened to
      bring her to my mind? Or is it simply that the god of dreams is a
      capricious god?
    </p>
    <p>
      The influence of my dream, at any rate,&mdash;the bittersweet savour of
      it,&mdash;has pursued me through my waking hours. All day long to-day
      Zabetta has been my phantom guest. She has walked with me in the streets;
      she has waited at my elbow while I wrote or talked or read. Now, at
      tea-time, she is present with me by my study fireside, in the twilight.
      Her voice sounds faintly, plaintively, in my ears; her eyes gaze at me
      sadly from a pale reproachful face.... She bids me to the theatre of
      memory, where my youth is rehearsed before me in mimic show. There was one&mdash;no,
      there were two little scenes in which Zabetta played the part of leading
      lady.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> do not care to
      specify the year in which it happened; it happened a terrible number of
      years ago; it happened when I was twenty. I had passed the winter in
      Naples,&mdash;oh, it had been a golden winter!&mdash;and now April had
      come, and my last Neapolitan day. Tomorrow I was to take ship for
      Marseilles, on the way to join my mother in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the afternoon; and I was climbing one of those crooked staircase
      alleys that scale the hillsides behind the town, the salita&mdash;is
      there, in Naples, a Salita Santa Margherita? I had lunched (for the last
      time!) at the Café d&rsquo;.urope, and had then set forth upon a last haphazard
      ramble through the streets. It was tremulous spring weather, with blue
      skies, soft breezes, and a tender sun; the sort of weather that kindles
      perilous ardours even in the blood of middle age, and turns the blood of
      youth to wildfire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Women sat combing their hair, and singing, and gossiping, before the
      doorways of their pink and yellow houses; children sprawled, and laughed,
      and quarrelled in the dirt. Pifferari, in sheep-skins and sandals,
      followed by prowling, gaunt-limbed dogs, droned monotonous nasal melodies
      from their bagpipes. Priests picked their way gingerly over the muddy
      cobble stones, sleek, black-a-vised priests, with exaggerated hats, like
      Don Basilio&rsquo;s in the <i>Barbiere</i>. Now and then one passed a fat brown
      monk; or a soldier; or a white-robed penitent, whose eyes glimmered
      uncannily from the peep-holes of the hood that hid his face; or a comely
      contadina, in her smart costume, with a pomegranate-blossom flaming behind
      her ear, and red lips that curved defiantly as she met the covetous
      glances wildfire-and-twenty no doubt bestowed upon her&mdash;whereat,
      perhaps, wildfire-and-twenty halted and hesitated for an instant, debating
      whether to accept the challenge and turn and follow her. A flock of
      milk-purveying goats jangled their bells a few yards below me. Hawkers
      screamed their merchandise, fish, and vegetables, and early fruit&mdash;apricots,
      figs, green almonds. Brown-skinned, barelegged boys shouted at
      long-suffering donkeys, and whacked their flanks with sticks. And
      everybody, more or less, importuned you for coppers. &ldquo;Mossou, mossou! Un
      piccolo soldo, per l&rsquo;amor di Dio!&rdquo; The air was vibrant with Southern human
      noises and dense with Southern human smells&mdash;amongst which, here and
      there, wandered strangely a lost waft of perfume from some neighbouring
      garden, a scent of jasmine or of orange flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, suddenly, the salita took a turn, and broadened into a small
      piazza. At one hand there was a sheer terrace, dropping to tiled roofs
      twenty feet below; and hence one got a splendid view, over the town, of
      the blue bay, with its shipping, and of Capri, all rose and purple in the
      distance, and of Vesuvius with its silver wreath of smoke. At the other
      hand loomed a vast, discoloured, pink-stuccoed palace, with grated
      windows, and a porte-cochère black as the mouth of a cavern; and the upper
      stories of the palace were in ruins, and out of one corner of their
      crumbling walls a palm-tree grew. The third side of the piazza was
      inevitably occupied by a church, a little pearl-grey rococo edifice, with
      a bell, no deeper toned than a common dinner-bell, which was now
      frantically ringing. About the doors of the church countless written
      notices were pasted, advertising indulgences; beggars clung to the steps,
      like monster snails; and the greasy leathern portière was constantly being
      drawn aside, to let some one enter or come out.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was here that I
      met Zabetta.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heavy portière swung open, and a young girl stepped from the darkness
      behind it into the sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw a soft face, with brown eyes; a plain black frock, with a little
      green nosegay stuck in its belt; and a small round scarlet hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hideous old beggar woman stretched a claw towards this apparition,
      mumbling something. The apparition smiled, and sought in its pocket, and
      made the beggar woman the richer by a soldo.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was twenty, and the April wind was magical. I thought I had never seen
      so beautiful a smile, a smile so radiant, so tender.
    </p>
    <p>
      I watched the young girl as she tripped down the church steps, and crossed
      the piazza, coming towards me. Her smile lingered, fading slowly, slowly,
      from her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she neared me, her eyes met mine. For a second we looked straight into
      each other&rsquo;s eyes....
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, there was nothing bold, nothing sophisticated or immodest, in the
      momentary gaze she gave me. It was a natural, spontaneous gaze of
      perfectly frank, of perfectly innocent and impulsive interest, in exchange
      for mine of open admiration. But it touched the wildfire in my veins, and
      made it leap tumultuously.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>appiness often
      passes close to us without our suspecting it, the proverb says.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl moved on; and I stood still, feeling dimly that something
      precious had passed close to me. I had not turned back to follow any of
      the brazenly provocative contadine. But now I could not help it. Something
      precious had passed within arm&rsquo;s reach of me. I must not let it go,
      without at least a semblance of pursuing it. If I waited there passive
      till she was out of sight, my regrets would be embittered by the
      recollection that I had not even tried.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed her eagerly, but vaguely, in a tremor or unformulated hopes and
      fears. I had no definite intentions, no designs. Presently, doubtless, she
      would come to her journey&rsquo;s end&mdash;she would disappear in a house or
      shop&mdash;and I should have my labour for my pains. Nevertheless, I
      followed. What would you? She was young, she was pretty, she was neatly
      dressed. She had big bright brown eyes, and a slender waist, and a little
      round scarlet hat set jauntily upon a mass of waving soft brown hair. And
      she walked gracefully, with delicious undulations, as if to music, lifting
      her skirts up from the pavement, and so disclosing the daintiest of feet,
      in trim buttoned boots of glazed leather, with high Italian heels. And her
      smile was lovely&mdash;and I was twenty&mdash;and it was April. I must not
      let her escape me, without at least a semblance of pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      She led me down the salita that I had just ascended. She could scarcely
      know that she was being followed, for she had not once glanced behind her.
    </p>

    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t first I followed
      meekly, unperceived, and contented to remain so.
    </p>
    <p>
      But little by little a desire for more aggressive measures grew within me.
      I said, &ldquo;Why not&mdash;instead of following meekly&mdash;why not overtake
      and outdistance her, then turn round, and come face to face with her
      again? And if again her eyes should meet mine as frankly as they met them
      in the piazza....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mere imagination of their doing so made my heart stop beating.
    </p>
    <p>
      I quickened my pace. I drew nearer and nearer to her. I came abreast of
      her&mdash;oh, how the wildfire trembled! I pressed on for a bit, and then,
      true to my resolution, turned back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes did meet mine again quite frankly. What was more, they brightened
      with a little light of surprise, I might almost have fancied a little
      light of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the mere imagination of the thing had made my heart stop beating, the
      thing itself set it to pounding, racing, uncontrollably, so that I felt
      all but suffocated, and had to catch my breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew now that the young man she had passed in the piazza had followed
      her of set purpose; and she was surprised, but, seemingly, not displeased.
      They were wonderfully gentle, wonderfully winning eyes, those eyes she
      raised so frankly to my desirous ones; and innocent, innocent, with all
      the unsuspecting innocence of childhood. In years she might be seventeen,
      older perhaps; but there was a child&rsquo;s fearless unconsciousness of evil in
      her wide brown eyes. She had not yet been taught (or, anyhow, she clearly
      didn&rsquo;t believe) that it is dangerous and unbecoming to exchange glances
      with a stranger in the streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was as good as smiling on me. Might I dare the utmost? Might I venture
      to speak to her?... My heart was throbbing too violently. I could not have
      found an articulate human word, nor a shred of voice, nor a pennyweight of
      self-assurance, in my body. .
    </p>
    <p>
      So, thrilling with excitement, quailing in panic, I passed her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I passed her, and kept on up the narrow alley for half a dozen steps, when
      again I turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing where I had left her, looking after me. There was the
      expression of unabashed disappointment in her dark eyes now, which, in a
      minute, melted to an expression of appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, aren&rsquo;t you going to speak to me, after all?&rdquo; they pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wooed by those soft monitors, I plucked up a sort of desperate courage.
      Hot coals burned in my cheeks, something flattered terribly in my breast;
      I was literally quaking in every limb. My spirit was exultant, but my
      flesh was faint. Her eyes drew me, drew me.... I fancy myself awkwardly
      raising my hat; I hear myself accomplish a half-smothered salutation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buon&rsquo; giorno, Signorina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face lit up with that celestial smile of hers; and in a voice that was
      like ivory and white velvet, she returned, &ldquo;Buon&rsquo; giorno, Signorino.&rdquo;
     </p>

      know how long we stood together in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This would never do, I recognised. I must not stand before her in silence,
      like a guilty schoolboy. I must feign composure. I must carry off the
      situation lightly, like a man of the world, a man of experience. I groped
      anxiously in the confusion ot my wits for something that might pass for an
      apposite remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last I had a flash or inspiration. &ldquo;What&mdash;what fine weather,&rdquo; I
      gasped. &ldquo;Che bel tempo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, molto bello,&rdquo; she responded. It was like a cadenza on a flute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you are going into the town?&rdquo; I questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I&mdash;may I have the pleasure&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But yes,&rdquo; she consented, with an inflection that wondered. &ldquo;What else
      have you spoken to me for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And we set off down the salita, side by side.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>he had exquisite
      little white ears, with little coral earrings, like drops of blood; and a
      perfect rosebud mouth, a mouth that matched her eyes for innocence and
      sweetness. Her scarlet hat burned in the sun, and her brown hair shook
      gently under it. She had plump little soft white hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, when I had begun to feel more at my ease, I hazarded a
      question. &ldquo;You are a republican, Signorina?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she assured me, with a puzzled elevation of the brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, then you are a cardinal,&rdquo; I concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a silvery trill of laughter, and asked, &ldquo;Why must I be either a
      republican or a cardinal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wear a scarlet hat&mdash;a <i>bonnet rouge"</i>, I explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      At which she laughed again, crisply, merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are French,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you wish, Signorina; but I had never thought so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And still again she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come from church,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Già,&rdquo; she assented; &ldquo;from confession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? And did you have a great many wickednesses to confess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; many, many,&rdquo; she answered, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now have you got a heavy penance to perform?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; only twenty <i>aves</i>. And I must turn my tongue seven times in my
      mouth before I speak, whenever I am angry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, then you are given to being angry? You have a bad temper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dreadful, dreadful,&rdquo; she cried, nodding her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was my turn to laugh now. &ldquo;Then I must be careful not to vex you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But I will turn my tongue seven times before I speak, if you do,&rdquo;
       she promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going far?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going nowhere. I am taking a walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we go to the Villa Nazionale, and watch the driving?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or to the Toledo, and look at the shop-windows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can do both. We will begin at the Toledo, and end in the Villa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bene,&rdquo; she acquiesced.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little silence, &ldquo;I am so glad I met you,&rdquo; I informed her, looking
      into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He eyes softened adorably. &ldquo;I am so glad too,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are lovely, you are sweet,&rdquo; I vowed, with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;I am as God made me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are lovely, you are sweet. I thought&mdash;when I first saw you,
      above there, in the piazza&mdash;when you came out of church, and gave the
      soldo to the old beggar woman&mdash;I thought you had the loveliest smile
      I had ever seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A beautiful blush suffused her face, and her eyes swam in a mist of
      pleasure. &ldquo;É vero?&rdquo; she questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, vero, vero. That is why I followed you. You don&rsquo;t mind my having
      followed you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; I am glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After another interval of silence, &ldquo;You are not Neapolitan?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You
      don&rsquo;t speak like a Neapolitan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I am Florentine. We live in Naples for my father&rsquo;s health. He is not
      strong. He cannot endure the cold winters of the North.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I murmured something sympathetic; and she went on, &ldquo;My father is a
      violinist. To-day he has gone to Capri, to play at a festival. He will not
      be back until to-morrow. So I was very lonesome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother is dead,&rdquo; she said, crossing herself. In a moment she added,
      with a touch of pride, &ldquo;During the season my father plays in the orchestra
      of the San Carlo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I know what your name is,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh? How can you know? What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think your name is Rosabella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, then you are wrong. My name is Elisabetta. But in Naples everybody
      says Zabetta. And yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I cannot guess. Not&mdash;not Federico?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I look as if my name were Federico?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She surveyed me gravely for a minute, then shook her head pensively. &ldquo;No;
      I do not think your name is Federico.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And therewith I told her my name, and made her repeat it till she could
      pronounce it without a struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It sounded very pretty, coming from her pretty lips, quite Southern and
      romantic, with its r&rsquo;s tremendously enriched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow, I know your age,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are seventeen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;ever so much older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighteen then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be nineteen in July.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>efore the
      brilliant shop-windows of the Toledo we dallied for an hour or more,
      Zabetta&rsquo;s eyes sparkling with delight as they rested on the bright-hued
      silks, the tortoiseshell and coral, the gold and silver filagree-work,
      that were there displayed. But when she admired some one particular object
      above another, and I besought her to let me buy it for her, she refused
      austerely. &ldquo;But no, no, no! It is impossible.&rdquo; Then we went on to the
      Villa, and strolled by the sea-wall, between the blue-green water and the
      multicoloured procession of people in carriages. And by-and-by Zabetta
      confessed that she was tired, and proposed that we should sit down on one
      of the benches. &ldquo;A café would be better fun,&rdquo; submitted her companion. And
      we placed ourselves at one of the out-of-door tables of the café in the
      garden, where, after some urging, I prevailed upon Zabetta to drink a cup
      of chocolate. Meanwhile, with the ready confidence of youth, we had each
      been desultorily autobiographical; and if our actual acquaintance was only
      the affair of an afternoon, I doubt if in a year we could have felt that
      we knew each other better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go home,&rdquo; Zabetta said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not yet, not yet,&rdquo; cried I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be dinner-time. I must go home to dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your father is at Capri. You will have to dine alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t. Come with me instead, and dine at a restaurant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes glowed wistfully for an instant; but she replied, &ldquo;Oh, no; I
      cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you can. Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, because.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is my cat. She will have nothing to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your cook will give her something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My cook!&rdquo; laughed Zabetta. &ldquo;My cook is here before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you must be a kind mistress. You must give your cook an evening
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my poor cat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your cat can catch a mouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no mice in our house. She has frightened them all away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she can wait. A little fast will be good for her soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zabetta laughed, and I said, &ldquo;Andiamo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the restaurant we climbed to the first floor, and they gave us a table
      near the window, whence we could look out over the villa to the sea
      beyond. The sun was sinking, and the sky was gay with rainbow tints, like
      mother-of-pearl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zabetta&rsquo;s face shone joyfully. &ldquo;This is only the second time in my life
      that I have dined in a restaurant,&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;And the other time was
      very long ago, when I was quite young. And it wasn&rsquo;t nearly so grand a
      restaurant as this, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now what would you like to eat?&rdquo; I asked, picking up the bill of
      fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I look?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      I handed her the document, and she studied it at length. I think, indeed,
      she read it through. In the end she appeared rather bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there is so much. I don&rsquo;t know. Will you choose, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made a shift at choosing, and the sympathetic waiter flourished
      kitchenwards with my commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that little green nosegay you wear in your belt, Zabetta?&rdquo; I
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this&mdash;it is rosemary. Smell it,&rdquo; she said, breaking off a sprig
      and offering it to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rosemary&mdash;that&rsquo;s for remembrance,&rdquo; quoted I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that mean? What language is that?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to translate it to her. And then I taught her to say it in
      English. &ldquo;Rrosemérri&mdash;tsat is forr rremembrrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you write it down for me?&rdquo; she requested. &ldquo;It is pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I wrote it for her on the back of one of my cards.
    </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>fter dinner we
      crossed the garden again, and again stood by the sea-wall. Over us the
      soft spring night was like a dark sapphire. Points of red, green, and
      yellow fire burned from the ships in the bay, and seemed of the same
      company as the stars above them. A rosy aureole in the sky, to the
      eastward, marked the smouldering crater of Vesuvius. Away in the Chiaja a
      man was singing comic songs, to an accompaniment of mandolines and
      guitars; comic songs that sounded pathetic, as they reached us in the
      distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked Zabetta how she wished to finish the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to go the play?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do <i>you</i> wish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I should like to stay here a little longer. It is pleasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We leaned on the parapet, close to each other. Her face was very pale in
      the starlight; her eyes were infinitely deep, and dark, and tender. One of
      her little hands lay on the stone wall, like a white flower. I took it. It
      was warm and soft. She did not attempt to withdraw it. I bent over it and
      kissed it. I kissed it many times. Then I kissed her lips. &ldquo;Zabetta&mdash;I
      love you&mdash;I love you,&rdquo; I murmured fervently.&mdash;Don&rsquo;t imagine that
      I didn&rsquo;t mean it. It was April, and I was twenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you, Zabetta. Dearest little Zabetta! I love you so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;É vero?&rdquo; she questioned, scarcely above her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, si; é vero, vero, vero,&rdquo; I asseverated. &ldquo;And you? And you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I love you,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then I could say no more. The ecstasy that filled my heart was too
      poignant. We stood there speechless, hand in hand, and breathed the air of
      heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by Zabetta drew her bunch of rosemary from her belt, and divided it
      into two parts. One part she gave to me, the other she kept. &ldquo;Rosemary&mdash;it
      is for constancy,&rdquo; she said. I pressed the cool herb to my face for a
      moment, inhaling its bitter-sweet fragrance; then I fastened it in my
      buttonhole. On my watch-chain I wore&mdash;what everybody in Naples used
      to wear&mdash;a little coral hand, a little clenched coral hand, holding a
      little golden dagger. I detached it now, and made Zabetta take it. &ldquo;Coral&mdash;that
      is also for constancy,&rdquo; I reminded her; &ldquo;and besides, it protects one from
      the Evil Eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      X
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t last Zabetta
      asked me what time it was; and when she learned that it was half-past
      nine, she insisted that she really must go home. &ldquo;They shut the outer door
      of the house we live in at ten o&rsquo;clock, and I have no key.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can ring up the porter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there is no porter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if we had gone to the theatre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have had to leave you in the middle of the play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; I consented; and we left the villa and took a cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you happy, Zabetta?&rdquo; I asked her, as the cab rattled us towards our
      parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, so happy, so happy! I have never been so happy before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Zabetta!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will love me always?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always, always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will see each other every day. We will see each other to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to-morrow!&rdquo; I groaned suddenly, the actualities of life rushing all
      at once upon my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? What of to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to-morrow, to-morrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? What?&rdquo; Her voice was breathless with suspense, with alarm. &ldquo;Oh, I
      had forgotten. You will think I am a beast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? For heaven&rsquo;s sake, tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will think I am a beast. You will think I have deceived you.
      To-morrow&mdash;I cannot help it&mdash;I am not my own master&mdash;I am
      summoned by my parents&mdash;to-morrow I am going away&mdash;I am leaving
      Naples.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are leaving Naples?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Paris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a breathing-space of silence. Then, &ldquo;Oh, Dio!&rdquo; sobbed Zabetta;
      and she began to cry as if her heart would break.
    </p>
    <p>
      I seized her hands; I drew her to me. I tried to comfort her. But she only
      cried and cried and cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zabetta... Zabetta.... Don&rsquo;t cry... Forgive me.... Oh, don&rsquo;t cry like
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dio! Oh, caro Dio!&rdquo; she sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zabetta&mdash;listen to me,&rdquo; I began. &ldquo;I have something to say to
      you....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cosa?&rdquo; she asked faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zabetta&mdash;do you really love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, tanto, tanto!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, listen, Zabetta. If you really love me&mdash;come with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with you. How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me to Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Paris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another instant of silence, and then again Zabetta began to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you? Will you? Will you come with me to Paris?&rdquo; I implored her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I would, I would. But I can&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Why can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my father&mdash;I cannot leave my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father? But&mdash;if you love me&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is old. He is ill. He has no one but me. I cannot leave him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zabetta!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. I cannot leave him. Oh, Dio mio!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Zabetta&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It would be a sin. Oh, the worst of sins. He is old and ill. I cannot
      leave him. Don&rsquo;t ask me. It would be dreadful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then? Then what? What shall we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. I wish I were dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cab came to a standstill, and Zabetta said, &ldquo;Here we are.&rdquo; I helped
      her to descend. We were before a dark porte-cochêre, in some dark
      back-street, high up the hillside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Addio,&rdquo; said Zabetta, holding out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t come with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t. Addio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Zabetta! Do you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Oh, say, say that you forgive
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Addio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, Zabetta, you&mdash;you have my address. It is on the card I gave
      you. If you ever need anything&mdash;if you are ever in trouble of any
      kind&mdash;remember you have my address&mdash;you will write to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Addio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Addio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood for a second, looking up at me from great brimming eyes, and
      then she turned away and vanished in the darkness of the porte-cochère. I
      got into the cab, and was driven to my hotel.
    </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nd here, one might
      have supposed, was an end of the episode; but no.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to Paris, I went to New York, I returned to Paris, I came on to
      London; and in this journeying more than a year was lost. In the beginning
      I had suffered as much as you could wish me in the way of contrition, in
      the way of regret too. I blamed myself and pitied myself with almost equal
      fervour. I had trifled with a gentle human heart; I had been compelled to
      let a priceless human treasure slip from my possession. But&mdash;I was
      twenty. And there were other girls in the world. And a year is a long
      time, when we are twenty. Little by little the image of Zabetta faded,
      faded. By the year&rsquo;s end, I am afraid it had become very pale indeed....
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late June, and I was in London, when the post brought me a letter.
      The letter bore an Italian stamp, and had originally been directed to my
      old address in Paris. Thence (as the numerous redirections on the big
      square foreign envelope attested) it had been forwarded to New York;
      thence back again to Paris; and thence finally to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was written in the neatest of tiny copperplates; and this is a
      translation of what it said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Friend,&mdash;My poor father died last month in the German Hospital,
      after an illness of twenty-one days. Pray for his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am now alone and free, and if you still wish it, can come to you. It
      was impossible for me to come when you asked me; but you have not ceased
      to be my constant thought. I keep your coral hand.&mdash;Your ever
      faithful Zabetta Collaluce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Enclosed in the letter there was a sprig of some dried,
      bitter-sweet-smelling herb; and, in pencil, below the signature&mdash;laboriously
      traced, as I could guess, from what I had written for her on my
      visiting-card,&mdash;the English phrase: &ldquo;Rosemary&mdash;that&rsquo;s for
      remembrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The letter was dated early in May, which made it six weeks old.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could I do? What answer could I send?
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, you know what I did do. I procrastinated and vacillated, and
      ended by sending no answer at all. I could not write and say &ldquo;Yes, come to
      me.&rdquo; But how could I write and say &ldquo;No, do not come&ldquo;? Besides, would she
      not have given up hoping for an answer, by this time? It was six weeks
      since she had written. I tried to think that the worst was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my remorse took a new and a longer and a stronger lease of life. A
      vision of Zabetta, pale, with anxious eyes, standing at her window,
      waiting, waiting for a word that never came,&mdash;for months I could not
      chase it from my conscience; it was years before it altogether ceased its
      accusing visits.
    </p>

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nd then, last
      night, after a perfectly usual London day and evening, I went to bed and
      dreamed of her vividly; and all day long to-day the fragrance of my dream
      has clung about me,&mdash;a bitter-sweet fragrance, like that of rosemary
      itself. Where is Zabetta now? What is her life? How have the years treated
      her?... In my dream she was still eighteen. In reality&mdash;it is
      melancholy to think how far from eighteen she has had leisure, since that
      April afternoon, to drift.

    <p>
      Youth faces forward, impatient of the present, panting to anticipate the
      future. But we who have crossed a certain sad meridian, we turn our gaze
      backwards, and tell the relentless gods what we would sacrifice to recover
      a little of the past, one of those shining days when to us also it was
      given to sojourn among the Fortunate Islands. <i>Ah, si jeunesse

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
